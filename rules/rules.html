<br><br><p><h3 align="center">The Setting</h3></p>

<p><i><a target="_new" href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/127180/Scarlet-Heroes">Scarlet Heroes</a></i> contains the base rules, whereas <i><a target="_new" href="https://williammillerservices.com/scarlethorizons/index.html">Scarlet Horizons</a></i> is the name of my particular adventure setting and in some ways modifies the <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> rules. The rules of play are identical to the published Scarlet Heroes rules, except as noted below.</p>

<p>The setting is Earth hundreds of thousands of years after Y2K. Yes, land masses have drifted all over the globe. Yes, there are hundreds of islands in a strung-out archipelago, varying in size from a few acres to hundreds or even thousands of square miles.</p>

<p>Much time has passed: The Middle Ages, The Industrial Revolution, The Space Age, The Visitation, The Disaster and Great Declension, The Age of Ice and Darkness, and now ... finally ... The Time of the Red Tide. Yes, the world has moved on. Much has been lost to history, yet some things remain and there is still much to be gained or reclaimed for those with the drive to explore the setting's geography and lost history. <b>Welcome to <font color="#BB0000">Scarlet Horizons</font></b>.</p>

<p>The setting of Scarlet Horizons is Asian-themed post-apocalyptic fantasy in Earth's very far future. Most of the world has been consumed by something called the Red Tide, an alien horror that takes the form of a crimson mist, able to corrupt and consume both physically and through dreams.</p>

<p>The remaining population of the world fled to the Sunset Isles, an extensive archipelago located roughly where Great Britain existed hundreds of millenia ago. There, after driving the native Shou into the wilderness, they settled and formed new kingdoms.</p>

<p>The world saw unthinkable advances during The Visitation, suffered untold losses during the Great Declension. Sages speculate about what heights of exalted knowledge and fabled technology now lie hidden in the sediment of countless past generations. But for every tomb-plunderer and ruins-seeking archaeologist, there's a minion of the Ninefold Celestial Empire who is set on preventing the uncovering of veiled secrets from antiquity. Such things must remain shrouded, lest one faction or another gain advantage.</p>

<p>There are four major kingdoms in the setting â€“ the failing Mandarinate of Xian, once the ruler of the entire archipelago, the Hellsworn Shogunate of the North, the decadent Magocracy of Tien Lung, and finally the hard-working and faithful monotheistic Hohnberg Pact. But within some of these kingdoms, there are vast areas of wilderness that an aspiring PC might settle and rule over, if she has the people skills.</p>

<p>The Ten-Thousand Islands of the archipelago of the Sunset Isles are home to samurai and sohei, wu-jen and alchemists, gunslingers and barbarians, monks and paladins, rangers and tomb raiders, wardens and reclusive sorcerers, necromancers and sublime ascetics at remote monasteries, powerful shoguns in palaces, and fey monsters of the mundane, magical, and (human?) types.</p>

<p>Yes, red sorcery and the Shou exist, but they may or may not be the focus of various campaigns set in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i>. In my setting, there are the <i>Shou</i> and then there are the more grossly monstrous goblinoid races, the distinction being that the Shou are <i>believed to be</i> an evolved form of the former, perhaps through interbreeding with humanity in ages past, or through genetic engineering.</p>

<p>Certainly the spells available to adventurers may be drawn from the <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> book, but they may also be sourced from 1st ed. B/X, or from Labyrinth Lord.</p>

<p>Races and classes &mdash; except in regard to the Shou &mdash; are as detailed in <i>Scarlet Heroes</i>, and use the given attack bonus progression, hit point progression, etc., <i>except</i> that player-characters are created at Level 0 with normal Level 1 hit points and are then promoted immediately to Level 1 where they add additional HP based on class and Constitution bonus. Because PCs adventure either solo or with a single other PC (for a duet of heroes), this makes them a tad bit less squishy, for survivability purposes.</p> 

<p>There aren't any combat-specific advantages to the racial selection a player makes for her character.</p>

<p><h3 align="center">Combat</h3></p>


<p>Regardless of level attained, PCs only have a single roll-to-hit attack each round (the <i>Fray</i> die isn't rolled to-hit; it hits automatically and is rolled to see how many hit dice of damage the hero inflicts). The standard (non-Fray) attack is 1d20 + relevant attribute bonus + base attack bonus &mdash; plus any magical weapon bonus, if applicable. Monsters, on the other hand, may have more than a single attack per round. <i>But, that's not fair!</i> Hey, there's a reason most NPCs don't go adventuring or delving...</p>

<p>Skill checks use a 2d8 + relevant attribute bonus + highest relevant trait &mdash; just as described in the <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> rules. Saving throws are made the same way, except that the hero also adds her level.</p>

<p>A raw roll of 1 is always a failure, and a raw roll of 20 is always a success. A critical hit allows the attacker to add her Strength or Dexterity modifier (whichever is more applicable) to the regularly determined damage. For instance, Halitha the Duelist attacks using her rapier and scores a critical hit. She rolls a d6 and gets a 4 result. That translates to 1 point of damage. However, because it was a critical hit, she is able to add the modifier that applies to her Dex 18, so the damage becomes [1 + 3] = 4. Monster critical hit combat damage is handled differently. For every four full hit dice the monster possesses, one additional point of damage is done. Thus, if the PCs were fighting an 8-HD wyvern that scored a critical hit on a claw attack, the DM would determine damage normally and then add 2 more points of damage.</p> 

<p>Heroic Deeds that cost Risk Dice and yield a chance of something beneficial occurring for the PC.</p>

<p>Heroic Deeds cost Risk Dice because you risk expending these dice without gaining any benefit (it's always just a chance of success, never a guarantee), and sometimes you run other risks when attempting a Heroic Deed.</p>

<p>Player characters begin play at level 1 with a Risk Dice Pool of four Risk Dice. A Risk Die is an 8-sided die. Upon attaining a new character level evenly divisible by two (i.e., 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), the Risk Dice Pool gains another d8, up to a maximum Risk Dice Pool of fourteen d8 dice upon attaining level 20.</p>

<p>Upon attaining a new character level, a PC may learn an additional Heroic Deed. She may also trade out previously learned Deeds for other Deeds now preferred. The total number of Heroic Deeds known by a PC is equal to her level.</p>

<p>Multi-classed PCs may choose to learn a Heroic Deed from any category for which one of their classes qualifies them.</p>

<p>After a short rest, a PC's Risk Dice Pool regains a single d8. After a long rest, the Risk Dice Pool is restored to maximum. A long rest interrupted by combat becomes a short rest. A short rest interrupted by combat becomes no rest at all.</p>

<p>PCs start play at level 1 with knowledge of how to attempt three different Heroic Deeds. These deeds may be assigned by the DM, picked by the player (at the DM's discretion), or rolled for randomly on the Heroic Deeds Table.</p>

<p>A hero may voluntarily sacrifice a Risk Die in order to re-roll a saving throw, or to negate a monster's critical hit directed at that PC (the monster attack still hits, it just isn't a critical). A PC cannot expend a Risk Die to protect another PC in this manner.</p>

<p><h3 align="center">Encumbrance</h3></p>

<p>Regardless of character class or race, a backpack is presumed to contain the following gear inside it or attached to it externally via D-rings, and it is presumed that characters return to a village or town to restock their backpack between dungeon delves, or each time entering a new town &mdash; if traveling overland:</p>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 week's worth of iron rations<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 2 unused torches<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 spartan Duracloth blanket/tarp<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 40 ft. of balled twine<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 mess kit made of tin<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 50' hemp rope (looped & tied to pack externally)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; a firestarter device (in a side pouch)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 pint of strong spirits in a metallic flask<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; a one-quart waterskin lashed the pack<br></p3>

<p>The above is called a <i>standard backpack</i>. The standard backpack can be shrugged off the shoulders and dropped using a single combat action. Characters who are attacked while carrying their backpack suffer, at minimmum, a penalty of 1 to both armor class and attack rolls because of their awkward burden. Therefore, PCs will shrug off the backpack when possible before combat erupts. When surprised while bearing the backpack, the PC must take a combat action to divest himself of the backpack, or else face the aforementioned penalties.</p>

<p>The weight of potions is negligible. It is presumed they come in thin metallic vials that can't easily break, unless otherwise specified, because of their value. There is adequate space in the standard backpack's pouches for five potion vials. Alternatively, a belt pouch may serve to carry these.</p>

<p>A character may wear his class's standard clothing and/or armor, i.e., his class <i>harness</i>, without undue encumberance. PCs are lightly encumbered when in armor <i>and</i> wearing the standard backpack, regardless of their Strength score.</p>

<p>Any PC in <i>harness</i> and wearing his backpack, and carrying 10+ pounds of loot has encumbrance worsened by one category; 25+ pounds of loot worsens encumbrance by two categories. Particularly strong characters may add an additional ten pounds per point of Strength attribute bonus. Thus, a STR 18 character wearing harness and pack would not become moderate encumbered until carrying 40 pounds of loot, and wouldn't become heavily encumbered until carrying 55 pounds of loot. Characters with any negative Strength modifier can only carry worn clothing and a pack; they aren't robust enough to wear armor effectively, and they cannot carry more than five pounds of loot.</p>

<p>A mage's belt pouch of spell components adds negligible weight and is ignored for the purposes of determining encumbrance. Likewise, a cleric's worn holy symbol add negligible weight, and if the fighter carries a map the same applies. A mage's spellbook <i>does</i> add to encumbrance. That extra flagon of wine the fighter carries adds to encumbrance. If the cleric bears a weighty statuette as a gift intended for a nearby shrine, that adds to encumbrance. Such items as these should be listed under Loot on the character sheet. Technically, they may be carried inside the backpack, but list them separately under Loot so that everyone means the same thing by the term <i>standard backpack</i>: "Oh shit, I lost my backpack and it also had my [insert Loot items] in it!"</p>

<p>Unemcumbered characters are those wearing only normal clothing or class-normal armor and not bearing a standard backpack.</p>

<p>Lightly encumbered characters suffer -1 to attack rolls, Dexterity-based saving throws, and a +1 penalty to Armor class.</p>

<p>Moderately encumbered characters suffer -3 to attack rolls, Dexterity-based saving throws, and a +3 penalty to Armor class, and their movement is halved.</p>

<p>Heavily encumbered characters suffer -6 to attack rolls, Dexterity-based saving throws, and a +6 penalty to Armor class, and their movement is quartered.</p>

<p><h3 align="center">Wealth</h3></p>

<p>Copper pieces in the <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> setting are approximately the size and thickness of a modern-day American nickel, and 450 copper pieces weigh exactly one pound. Silver pieces in this setting are called <i>chroma</i>. They're the diameter of a modern-day American half-dollar piece, and 250 chroma weigh one pound. Gold pieces in this setting are called <i>royals</i>. They're the diameter of a modern-day American silver dollar, and 100 gold pieces weigh one pound.</p>

<p>You can see, then, that dungeon loot becomes encumbering rather quickly. For this reason, tomb robbers and dungeon plunderers often prefer gems, which have a much higher value-to-weight ratio than coinage. As a rough rule &mdash; gems vary some in size and weight, of course &mdash; one-thousand gems weigh one pound. This portability benefit has to be weighed against the particular utility of copper, silver, and gold for powering various devices and magicks in the <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> setting.</p>

<p>For PC-playable races, hitpoints-per-level are always a function of character class, not of race. Monsters, on the other hand, use a d8 hit die. Actual monster hit <i>points</i>, as opposed to hit <i>dice</i>, aren't usually needed in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i>, but if they are the Game Master should use d8 hit dice and any die that comes up '8' is added to the total and adds another die to the pool. For example, in determining the hit points for an 8-HD golem, the following might occur:</p>

<p3>&#x2022; roll 1 result: 7; cumulative HP: 7<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; roll 2 result: 3; cumulative HP: 10<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; roll 3 result: 8; cumulative HP: 18<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; bonus die from previous result of '8' results in: 5; cumulative HP: 23<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; roll 4 result: 2; cumulative HP: 25<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; roll 5 result: 6; cumulative HP: 31<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; roll 6 result: 8; cumulative HP: 39<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; bonus die from previous result of '8' results in: 6; cumulative HP: 47<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; roll 7 result: 5; cumulative HP: 52<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; roll 8 result: 2; cumulative HP: 54<br></p3><br>

<p>Why might we need to know a monster's <i>hit points</i> instead of it's <i>hit dice</i>, if we're using <i>Scarlet Heroes'</i> combat rules? Well, some monsters have abilities based upon hit points. For instance, some Labyrinth Lord dragons' breath weapons deal damage equal to the dragon's current hit points.</p>
