<br><br><p><h3 align="center">The Setting</h3></p>

<p><i><a target="_new" href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/127180/Scarlet-Heroes">Scarlet Heroes</a></i> contains the base rules, whereas <i><a target="_new" href="https://williammillerservices.com/scarlethorizons/index.html">Scarlet Horizons</a></i> is the name of my particular adventure setting and in some ways modifies the <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> rules. The rules of play are identical to the published Scarlet Heroes rules, except as noted below.</p>

<p>For clarity, these rules are specifically for play in solo or two-person PC parties. You're welcome to adapt them to a non-Scarlet Heroes style of play. Please just give appropriate attribution.</p>

<p>The setting is Earth hundreds of thousands of years after Y2K. Yes, land masses have drifted all over the globe. Yes, there are hundreds of islands in a strung-out archipelago, varying in size from a few acres to hundreds or even thousands of square miles.</p>

<p>Much time has passed: The Middle Ages, The Industrial Revolution, The Space Age, The Visitation, The Disaster and Great Declension, The Age of Ice and Darkness, and now ... finally ... The Time of the Red Tide. Yes, the world has moved on. Much has been lost to history, yet some things remain and there is still much to be gained or reclaimed for those with the drive to explore the setting's geography and lost history. <b>Welcome to <font color="#BB0000">Scarlet Horizons</font></b>.</p>

<p>The setting of Scarlet Horizons is Asian-themed post-apocalyptic fantasy in Earth's very far future. Most of the world has been consumed by something called the Red Tide, an alien horror that takes the form of a crimson mist, able to corrupt and consume both physically and through dreams.</p>

<p>The remaining population of the world fled to the Sunset Isles, an extensive archipelago located roughly where Great Britain existed hundreds of millenia ago. There, after driving the native Shou into the wilderness, they settled and formed new kingdoms.</p>

<p>The world saw unthinkable advances during The Visitation, suffered untold losses during the Great Declension. Sages speculate about what heights of exalted knowledge and fabled technology now lie hidden in the sediment of countless past generations. But for every tomb-plunderer and ruins-seeking archaeologist, there's a minion of the Ninefold Celestial Empire who is set on preventing the uncovering of veiled secrets from antiquity. Such things must remain shrouded, lest one faction or another gain advantage.</p>

<p>There are four major kingdoms in the setting â€“ the failing Mandarinate of Xian, once the ruler of the entire archipelago, the Hellsworn Shogunate of the North, the decadent Magocracy of Tien Lung, and finally the hard-working and faithful monotheistic Hohnberg Pact. But within some of these kingdoms, there are vast areas of wilderness that an aspiring PC might settle and rule over, if she has the people skills.</p>

<p>The Ten-Thousand Islands of the archipelago of the Sunset Isles are home to samurai and sohei, wu-jen and alchemists, gunslingers and barbarians, monks and paladins, rangers and tomb raiders, wardens and reclusive sorcerers, necromancers and sublime ascetics at remote monasteries, powerful shoguns in palaces, and fey monsters of the mundane, magical, and (human?) types.</p>

<p>Yes, red sorcery and the Shou exist, but they may or may not be the focus of various campaigns set in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i>. In my setting, there are the <i>Shou</i> and then there are the more grossly monstrous goblinoid races, the distinction being that the Shou are <i>believed to be</i> an evolved form of the former, perhaps through interbreeding with humanity in ages past, or through genetic engineering.</p>

<p>Certainly the spells available to adventurers may be drawn from the <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> book, but they may also be sourced from 1st ed. B/X, or from Labyrinth Lord.</p>

<p><h3 align="center">Races Usable As PCs</h3></p>

<p>Races and classes &mdash; except in regard to the Shou &mdash; are as detailed in <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> and below, and use their class's given attack bonus progression, hit point progression, etc., <i>except</i> that player-characters are created at Level 0 with normal Level 1 hit points and are then promoted immediately to Level 1 where they add additional HP based on class and Constitution bonus. Because PCs adventure either solo or with a single other PC (for a duet of heroes), this makes them a tad bit less squishy, for survivability purposes.</p>

<p><center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"></center></p>

<p><h3 align="center">PC-playable Classes</h3></p>

<p>The four core classes are Fighter, Cleric, Thief, and Magic-User. Subclasses off each of those core classes are possible in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> as follows:</p>

<p3>&#x2022; Fighter<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Barbarian<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Gunslinger<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Ranger<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Warden<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Cleric<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Archaeologist<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Paladin<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Sohei<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Magic-User<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Necromancer<br></p3>

<p><h3 align="center">Combat</h3></p>


<p>Regardless of level attained, PCs only have a single roll-to-hit attack each round (the <i>Fray</i> die isn't rolled to-hit; it hits automatically and is rolled to see how many hit dice of damage the hero inflicts). The standard (non-Fray) attack is 1d20 + relevant attribute bonus + base attack bonus &mdash; plus any magical weapon bonus, if applicable. Monsters, on the other hand, may have more than a single attack per round. <i>But, that's not fair!</i> Hey, there's a reason most NPCs don't go adventuring or delving...</p>

<p>A PC can move up to thirty feet (if unhindered by difficult terrain) and may make an attack roll before or after this movement. Alternatively, a PC may sacrifice their attack roll in order to move up to sixty feet.</p>

<p>For any given PC, the <i>Fray Die</i> cannot come into play each round unless the PC has some means to target it. For melee fighters not using a ranged weapon, this means they are limited to adjacent foes. Characters using ranged melee weapons (crossbows, bows, hurled axe, dagger, etc.) <i>could</i> make a ranged Fray attack, provided they have sufficient ammunition (or have retrieved that spear since the last time it was hurled) and a clear line of sight to their target. Mages in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> may target anyone within sixty feet with their Fray Die, as long as they can see the target.</p>

<p>Rarely, the Dungeon Master may have to inform a player that her character's Fray attack was ineffective. Perhaps the monster is immune to all attacks except the highest level spells, or weapons that carry a +3 magical bonus or higher. However, this should occur only rarely, as the Fray Die is integral to solo and duet play. At the DM's discretion, a failed Fray attack should be noticed by the character so that Fray attacks in future rounds can be beneficially targeted.</p>

<p>Skill checks use a 2d8 + relevant attribute bonus + highest relevant trait &mdash; just as described in the <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> rules. Saving throws are made the same way, except that the hero also adds her level.</p>

<p>A raw roll of 1 is always a failure, and a raw roll of 20 is always a success. Unless a raw d20 result of <i>20</i> is needed to-hit, a results of 20 indicates a <i>critical hit</i>. A critical hit allows the attacker to add her Strength or Dexterity modifier (whichever is more applicable) to the regularly determined damage.</p>

<p>For instance, Halitha the Duelist attacks using her rapier and scores a critical hit. She rolls a d6 and gets a 4 result. That translates to 1 point of damage. However, because it was a critical hit, she is able to add the modifier that applies to her Dex 18, so the damage becomes [1 + 3] = 4. Monster critical hit combat damage is handled differently. For every four full hit dice the monster possesses, one additional point of damage is done. Thus, if the PCs were fighting an 8-HD wyvern that scored a critical hit on a claw attack, the DM would determine damage normally and then add 2 more points of damage.</p> 

<p>Generally, a monster has the attack bonus of a Fighter whose level matches the monster's hit dice. Put another way, a monster's attack bonus, barring a different bonus given in the monster's description, is equal to its hit dice. Partial hit dice should be equated to the next whole number &mdash; for instance, a 3+1 HD monster would have a +4 attack bonus.</p>

<p><b><a target="_new" href="https://williammillerservices.com/2023/11/12/risk-dice-performing-deeds/">Heroic Deeds</a></b> cost Risk Dice and yield a chance of something beneficial occurring for the PC.</p>

<p>Heroic Deeds cost Risk Dice because usually you risk expending these dice without gaining any benefit (it's usually just a chance of success, not a guarantee), and sometimes you run other risks when attempting a Heroic Deed.</p>

<p>Player characters begin play at level 1 with a Risk Dice Pool of four Risk Dice. A Risk Die is an 8-sided die. Upon attaining a new character level evenly divisible by two (i.e., 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.), the Risk Dice Pool gains another d8, up to a maximum Risk Dice Pool of fourteen d8 dice upon attaining level 20.</p>

<p>First level PCs begin play with three known Heroic Deeds. Upon attaining a new character level, a PC learns an additional Heroic Deed. She may also trade out previously learned Deeds for other Deeds now preferred. The total number of Heroic Deeds known by a PC is equal to three plus her level.</p>

<p>Multi-classed PCs may choose to learn a Heroic Deed from any category for which one of their classes qualifies them.</p>

<p>After a short rest, a PC's Risk Dice Pool regains a single d8. After a long rest, the Risk Dice Pool is restored to maximum. A long rest interrupted by combat becomes a short rest. A short rest interrupted by combat becomes no rest at all.</p>

<p>PCs start play at level 1 with knowledge of how to attempt three different Heroic Deeds. These deeds may be assigned by the DM, picked by the player (at the DM's discretion), or rolled for randomly on the Heroic Deeds Table.</p>

<p>A hero may voluntarily sacrifice a Risk Die in order to re-roll a saving throw, or to negate a monster's critical hit directed at that PC (the monster attack still hits, it just isn't a critical). In the latter case, roll the Risk Die. You may subtract the result from the monster's additional critical damage inflicted. A PC cannot expend a Risk Die to protect another PC in this manner.</p>

<p><h3 align="center">Encumbrance</h3></p>

<p>Regardless of character class or race, a backpack is presumed to contain the following gear inside it or attached to it externally via D-rings, and it is presumed that characters return to a village or town to restock their backpack between dungeon delves, or each time entering a new town &mdash; if traveling overland:</p>

<p3>&#x2022; 1 week's worth of iron rations<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 2 unused torches<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 spartan Duracloth blanket/tarp<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 40 ft. of balled twine<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 mess kit made of tin<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 50' hemp rope (looped & tied to pack externally)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; a firestarter device (in a side pouch)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 pint of strong spirits in a metallic flask<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; a one-quart waterskin lashed the pack<br></p3>

<p>The above is called a <i>standard backpack</i>. The standard backpack can be shrugged off the shoulders and dropped using a single combat action. Characters who are attacked while carrying their backpack suffer, at minimmum, a penalty of 1 to both armor class and attack rolls because of their awkward burden. Therefore, PCs will shrug off the backpack when possible before combat erupts. When surprised while bearing the backpack, the PC must take a combat action to divest himself of the backpack, or else face the aforementioned penalties.</p>

<p>The weight of potions is negligible. It is presumed they come in thin metallic vials that can't easily break, unless otherwise specified, because of their value. There is adequate space in the standard backpack's pouches for five potion vials. Alternatively, a belt pouch may serve to carry these.</p>

<p>A character may wear his class's standard clothing and/or armor, i.e., his class <i>harness</i>, without undue encumberance. PCs are lightly encumbered when in armor <i>and</i> wearing the standard backpack, regardless of their Strength score.</p>

<p>Any PC in <i>harness</i> and wearing his backpack, and carrying 10+ pounds of loot has encumbrance worsened by one category; 25+ pounds of loot worsens encumbrance by two categories. Particularly strong characters may add an additional ten pounds per point of Strength attribute bonus. Thus, a STR 18 character wearing harness and pack would not become moderate encumbered until carrying 40 pounds of loot, and wouldn't become heavily encumbered until carrying 55 pounds of loot. Characters with any negative Strength modifier can only carry worn clothing and a pack; they aren't robust enough to wear armor effectively, and they cannot carry more than five pounds of loot.</p>

<p>A mage's belt pouch of spell components adds negligible weight and is ignored for the purposes of determining encumbrance. Likewise, a cleric's worn holy symbol add negligible weight, and if the fighter carries a map the same applies. A mage's spellbook <i>does</i> add to encumbrance. That extra flagon of wine the fighter carries adds to encumbrance. If the cleric bears a weighty statuette as a gift intended for a nearby shrine, that adds to encumbrance. Such items as these should be listed under Loot on the character sheet. Technically, they may be carried inside the backpack, but list them separately under Loot so that everyone means the same thing by the term <i>standard backpack</i>: "Oh shit, I lost my backpack and it also had my [insert Loot items] in it!"</p>

<p>Unemcumbered characters are those wearing only normal clothing or class-normal armor and not bearing a standard backpack.</p>

<p>Lightly encumbered characters suffer -1 to attack rolls, Dexterity-based saving throws, and a +1 penalty to Armor class.</p>

<p>Moderately encumbered characters suffer -3 to attack rolls, Dexterity-based saving throws, and a +3 penalty to Armor class, and their movement is halved.</p>

<p>Heavily encumbered characters suffer -6 to attack rolls, Dexterity-based saving throws, and a +6 penalty to Armor class, and their movement is quartered.</p>

<p><h3 align="center">Wealth</h3></p>

<p>Copper pieces in the <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> setting are approximately the size and thickness of a modern-day American nickel, and 450 copper pieces weigh exactly one pound. Silver pieces in this setting are called <i>chroma</i>. They're the diameter of a modern-day American half-dollar piece, and 250 chroma weigh one pound. Gold pieces in this setting are called <i>royals</i>. They're the diameter of a modern-day American silver dollar, and 100 gold pieces weigh one pound.</p>

<p>You can see, then, that dungeon loot becomes encumbering rather quickly. For this reason, tomb robbers and dungeon plunderers often prefer gems, which have a much higher value-to-weight ratio than coinage. As a rough rule &mdash; gems vary some in size and weight, of course &mdash; one-thousand gems weigh one pound. This portability benefit has to be weighed against the particular utility of copper, silver, and gold for powering various devices and magicks in the <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> setting.</p>

<p>Most copper pieces aren't to be found in circulation as currency but rather in quite considerable quantities in dungeons. As a result, most coins found in active circulation as currency are either silver, gold, or &mdash; more rarely &mdash; platinum. Copper is sufficiently rare in circulation so as to raise eyebrows. Pay for goods or services with copper pieces and you'll probably get an inquisitve, "Been adventurin', have ye?"</p>

<p>The reknowned tomb raider, archaeologist, and historian, Dr. Percival Longshanks, is famous among sages for postulating that at one time in the distant past copper pieces were indeed the <i>most</i> prevalent coinage in circulation. If he is correct, it begs the question why such coins are now to be found primarily only in ancient treasure caches &mdash; and particularly in dungeons.</p>

<p>A bevy of modern-day spells and machines &mdash; such as the CFF (Copper-Fed Furnace), to be found in palaces, other public buildings, and wealthy homes all across the Archipelago) &mdash; are fueled specifically by copper. There are cupric interpolators, copper-fed eldritch cannons, copper-powered self-rotating hourglasses, and the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>So ubitquitous is the use of copper than copper mining is a lucrative industry. Yet copper mines alone cannot keep up with demand, and thus there are adventuring parties who do nothing except delve for and retrieve copper. Two such prominent bands are Lady Liberty's Liberators and The Untarnished, which operate out of Tien Lung and the Hohnberg, respectively.</p>

<p>Given the utility of copper, therefore, it is not surprising that many adventurers are willing to forego carrying more individually valuable artistic treasures and coinage out of a delve and opt instead to pack out a few precious pounds of copper coins. After all, you <i>might</i> find a buyer for that ancient statuette, but <i>anyone</i> will pay well for copper.</p>

<p>Copper coins that have tarnished to a reddish hue are more valuable than the admittedly prettier bright and shiny version of the metal. Those that have progressed to the blackish hue of tarnish are even more valuable, and those tarnished to a sea-green are the most highly prized of all. On the open market, a pound of shiny copper is worth six royals; a pound of reddish copper, eight royals; blackish copper, ten royals; and sea-blue copper fifteen royals.</p>

<p>Copper has a wide spectrum of healing properties. One of the most fascinating things about copper is the fact that it is the third most common trace mineral within our bodies &mdash; linking people deeply with the soft shimmering ore. Clerics have learned to power-up certain spells by expending copper, and some mage spells that now have copper as a material component are said to have had quite different component requirements in the dim past.</p>

<p><h3 align="center">Hit Points Versus Hit Dice</h3></p>

<p>For PC-playable races, hitpoints-per-level are always a function of character class, not of race. Monsters, on the other hand, use a d8 hit die. Actual monster hit <i>points</i>, as opposed to hit <i>dice</i>, aren't usually needed in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i>, but if they are the Game Master should use d8 hit dice and any die that comes up '8' is added to the total and adds another die to the pool. For example, in determining the hit points for an 8-HD golem, the following might occur:</p>

<p3>Roll # [result] {cumulative}<br></p3><font color="gray"><tt>
<p4>roll 1 [7]{7}<br></p4>
<p4>roll 2 [3]{10}<br></p4>
<p4>roll 3 [8]{18}<br></p4>
<p4>bonus roll [5]{23}<br></p4>
<p4>roll 4 [2]{25}<br></p4>
<p4>roll 5 [6]{31}<br></p4>
<p4>roll 6 [8]{39}<br></p4>
<p4>bonus roll [6]{47}<br></p4>
<p4>roll 7 [5]{52}<br></p4>
<p4>roll 8 [2]{54}<br></p4><br></tt></font>

<p>Why might we need to know a monster's <i>hit points</i> instead of it's <i>hit dice</i>, if we're using <i>Scarlet Heroes'</i> combat rules? Well, some monsters have abilities based upon hit points. For instance, some Labyrinth Lord dragons' breath weapons deal damage equal to the dragon's current hit points.</p>
