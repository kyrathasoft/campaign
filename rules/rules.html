<b>Scarlet Horizons</b><br>
<font size="+1"><b>Rules of Play</b></font><br>
</font>
</center>


<p><i>Scarlet Heroes</i> contains the base rules, whereas <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> is the name of my particular adventure setting and in some ways modifies the <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> rules. The rules of play are identical to the published Scarlet Heroes rules, except as noted below.</p>

<p>The setting is Earth hundreds of thousands of years after Y2K. Yes, land masses have drifted all over the globe. Yes, there are hundreds of islands in a strung-out archipelago, varying in size from a few acres to hundreds or even thousands of square miles.</p> 

<p>Yes, red sorcery and the Shou exist, but they may or may not be the focus of various campaigns set in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i>. In my setting, there are the <i>Shou</i> and then there are the more grossly monstrous goblinoid races, the distinction being that the Shou are <i>believed to be</i> an evolved form of the former, perhaps through interbreeding with humanity in ages past, or through genetic engineering.</p>

<p>Certainly the spells available to adventurers may be drawn from the <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> book, but they may also be sourced from 1st ed. B/X, or from Labyrinth Lord.</p>

<p>Races and classes &mdash; except in regard to the Shou &mdash; are as detailed in <i>Scarlet Heroes</i>, and use the given attack bonus progression, hit point progression, etc., <i>except</i> that player-characters are created at Level 0 with normal Level 1 hit points and are then promoted immediately to Level 1 where they add additional HP based on class and Constitution bonus. Because PCs adventure either solo or with a single other PC (for a duet of heroes), this makes them a tad bit less squishy, for survivability purposes.</p> 

<p>Regardless of level attained, PCs only have a single roll-to-hit attack each round (the <i>Fray</i> die isn't rolled to-hit; it hits automatically and is rolled to see how many hit dice of damage the hero inflicts). This is 1d20 + relevant attribute bonus + base attack bonus. Monsters, on the other hand, may have more than a single attack per round.</p>

<p>Skill checks use a 2d8 + relevant attribute bonus + highest relevant trait &mdash; just as described in the <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> rules. Saving throws are made the same way, except that the hero also adds her level.</p>

<p>Regardless of character class or race, a backpack is presumed to contain the following gear inside it or attached to it externally via D-rings, and it is presumed that characters return to a village or town to restock their backpack between dungeon delves, or each time entering a new town &mdash; if traveling overland:</p>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 week's worth of iron rations<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 2 unused torches<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 spartan Duracloth blanket/tarp<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 40 ft. of balled twine<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 mess kit made of tin<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 50' hemp rope (looped & tied to pack externally)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; a firestarter device (in a side pouch)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; 1 pint of strong spirits in a metallic flask<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; a one-quart waterskin lashed the pack<br></p3>

<p>The above is called a <i>standard backpack</i>. The standard backpack can be shrugged off the shoulders and dropped using a single combat action. Characters who are attacked while carrying their backpack suffer, at minimmum, a penalty of 1 to both armor class and attack rolls because of their awkward burden. Therefore, PCs will shrug off the backpack when possible before combat erupts. When surprised while bearing the backpack, the PC must take a combat action to divest himself of the backpack, or else face the aforementioned penalties.</p>

<p>The weight of potions is negligible. It is presumed they come in thin metallic vials that can't easily break, unless otherwise specified, because of their value. There is adequate space in the standard backpack's pouches for five potion vials. Alternatively, a belt pouch may serve to carry these.</p>

<p>A character may wear his class's standard clothing and/or armor, i.e., his class <i>harness</i>, without undue encumberance. PCs are lightly encumbered when in armor and wearing the standard backpack, regardless of their Strength score.</p>

<p>Any PC in <i>harness</i> and wearing his backpack, and carrying 10+ pounds of loot has encumbrance worsened by one category; 25+ pounds of loot worsens encumbrance by two categories. Particularly strong characters may add an additional ten pounds per point of Strength attribute bonus. Thus, a STR 18 character wearing harness and pack would not become moderate encumbered until carrying 40 pounds of loot, and wouldn't become heavily encumbered until carrying 55 pounds of loot. Characters with any negative Strength modifier can only carry worn clothing and a pack; they aren't robust enough to wear armor effectively, and they cannot carry more than five pounds of loot.</p>

<p>Unemcumbered characters are those wearing only normal clothing or class-normal armor and not bearing a standard backpack.</p>

<p>Lightly encumbered characters suffer -1 to attack rolls, Dexterity-based saving throws, and a +1 penalty to Armor class.</p>

<p>Moderately encumbered characters suffer -3 to attack rolls, Dexterity-based saving throws, and a +3 penalty to Armor class, and their movement is halved.</p>

<p>Heavily encumbered characters suffer -6 to attack rolls, Dexterity-based saving throws, and a +6 penalty to Armor class, and their movement is quartered.</p>

<p>Copper pieces in the <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> setting are approximately the size and thickness of a modern-day American nickel, and 450 copper pieces weigh exactly one pound. Silver pieces in this setting are called <i>chroma</i>. They're the diameter of a modern-day American half-dollar piece, and 250 chroma weigh one pound. Gold pieces in this setting are called <i>royals</i>. They're the diameter of a modern-day American silver dollar, and 100 gold pieces weigh one pound.</p>

<p>You can see, then, that dungeon loot becomes encumbering rather quickly. For this reason, tomb robbers and dungeon plunderers often prefer gems, which have a much higher value-to-weight ratio than coinage. As a rough rule &mdash; gems vary some in size and weight, of course &mdash; one-thousand gems weigh one pound. This portability benefit has to be weighed against the particular utility of copper, silver, and gold for powering various devices and magicks in the <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> setting.</p>
