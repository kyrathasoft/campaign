<p>Matthias puts the three torches he <i>found</i> under his bed at The Brazen Strumpet next to his other three remaining torches in one corner of his room. <i>This could get to be problematic.</i> This recently discovered &mdash; and undoubtedly magically-fuelled &mdash; ability of his to <i>find</i> torches, seemingly no matter where he is located, has an enticing side effect: it sometimes also causes one or more <span title="Royals are gold pieces"><sc>royals</sc></span> to appear, along with the torches.</p>

<p>"Well, not <i>this</i> time," he concedes, lamenting the lack of any accompanying coins when these most recent torches were ... <i>found</i>. But the previous evening <i>was</i> financially advantageous. And so the scholar-mage anticipates many future occurences of happily exclaiming, aloud or not, '<a href="../../classes/deeds.html#ohTorches">Oh Look, More Torches</a>!'</p>

<p>Preparing to go downstairs to join his friends for supper, he turns to the tub now full of cooling (and quite dirty) water. A servant will drain the tub while he's at dinner, then clean it. He dresses in fresh trousers and tunic, and then turns to his bed and bedside table. One of the benefits of membership in The Seekers is the sharply discounted &mdash; sometimes even <i>pro bono</i> &mdash; services from its skilled members.</p>

<p>He steps first  to the bedside table and picks up an attractive mithril ring fashioned to look like a band formed from interwoven vines. He turns it over in his fingers. To him, it has value beyond even it's artistic beauty. It is a <i>ring of protection +1</i> &mdash; not that Matthias things of it in those terms. He thinks of it as a <i>talisman against harm.</i> He slides it onto his left hand's ring finger. "Long may it protect me."</p>

<p>Turning to the bed, he takes up the beautiful midnight blue cloak found in the crypt earlier in the day. Magen Eisenthrast identified it as a <i>cloak of protection +1</i>.</p>

<p>Matthias had argued politely that Aury should take it, but the cleric and their guide, Brother Jasyn, had insisted <a href="../characters/mattie.html">Mattie</a> be the one to wear it. He's always been smaller and not as good a fighter as Aury. He puts on the cloak, luxuriating in its supple strength and beautiful craftsmanship. Normally, he'd have donned his <span title="Mages can spellcast in light armor in the Scarlet Horizons setting"><sc>leather armor</sc></span> before the cloak, but it's being cleaned at the Chapterhouse by an initiate.</p>
