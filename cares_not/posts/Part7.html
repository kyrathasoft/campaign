<p>We resume our story after darkness has fallen on October 23, 204 Post-Ravaging. The heroes have returned to Helix without further encounters in the marsh.</p>

<div class="mech">Brother Jasyn is ~30% of the way to his 7th overall character level, while our two Seekers are ~26% of the way to their 3rd overall character level &mdash; that is, at least, until Aury sells the necromantic tapestry and converts 2,300 GP of wealth to XP by investing in shares of the Chapterhouse. Consequently, Aury gains a level (3rd overall), choosing to advance again in the Cleric class.</div>

<p>Matthias puts the three torches he <i>found</i> under his bed at The Brazen Strumpet next to his other three remaining torches in one corner of his room. <i>This could get to be problematic.</i> This recently discovered &mdash; and undoubtedly magically-fueled &mdash; ability of his to <i>find</i> torches, seemingly no matter where he is located, has an enticing side effect: it sometimes also causes one or more <span title="Royals are gold pieces"><sc>royals</sc></span> to appear, along with the torches.</p>

<p>"Well, not <i>this</i> time," he concedes, lamenting the lack of any accompanying coins when these most recent torches were ... <i>found</i>. But the previous evening <i>was</i> financially advantageous. And so the scholar-mage anticipates many future occurrences of happily exclaiming, aloud or not, '<a href="../../classes/deeds.html#ohTorches">Oh Look, More Torches</a>!'</p>

<p>Preparing to go downstairs to join his friends for supper, he turns to the tub now full of cooling (and quite dirty) water. A servant will drain the tub while he's at dinner, then clean it. He dresses in fresh trousers and tunic, and then turns to his bed and bedside table. One of the benefits of membership in The Seekers is the sharply discounted &mdash; sometimes even <i>pro bono</i> &mdash; services from its skilled members. In this particular case, magic item identification.</p>

<p>He steps first  to the bedside table and picks up an attractive mithril ring fashioned to look like a band formed from interwoven vines. He turns it over in his fingers. To him, it has value beyond even it's artistic beauty. It is a <span title="Confers a 1-step improvement to armor class, and a +1 bonus to saving throws"><sc><i>ring of protection +1</i></sc></span> &mdash; not that Matthias thinks of it in those terms. He thinks of it as a <i>talisman against harm.</i> He slides it onto his left hand's ring finger. "Long may it protect me."</p>

<p>Turning to the bed, he takes up the beautiful midnight blue cloak found in the crypt earlier in the day. <a href="../../html/terminology.html#magen">Magen Eisenthrast</a> identified it as a <span title="Confers a 1-step improvement to armor class, and a +1 bonus to saving throws"><sc><i>cloak of protection +1</i></sc></span>. Fortuitously, the effects of both the ring and cloak stack with one another. When wearing his leather armor, Mattie willl now enjoy an AC 6 instead of AC 8.</p>

<p>Matthias had argued politely that Aury should take it, but the cleric and their guide, Brother Jasyn, had insisted <a href="../characters/mattie.html">Mattie</a> be the one to wear it. He's always been smaller and not as good a fighter as Aury. He puts on the cloak, luxuriating in its supple strength and beautiful craftsmanship. Normally, he'd have donned his <span title="Mages can spellcast in light armor in the Scarlet Horizons setting"><sc>leather armor</sc></span> before the cloak, but it's being cleaned at the Chapterhouse by an initiate.</p>

<center><img src="../../images/dividers/divider1.png"></center>

<p>At the man-hole covered entrance to the Chapterhouse, Brother Jasyn had temporarily parted ways with the Seekers. "I'm sorry," Aury had said. "But the Father Abbot permits only Seekers within."</p>

<p>"No, I of course understand. I'm going to go on over to The Brazen Strumpet and get us each a room for the night. I'll pay for nice rooms, all the amenities. My treat. I've not stayed there since they added the new wing, but I understand it's very nice. I'll see you both shortly." And their guide had taken his leave of them.</p>

<p>Down on the third sublevel, Matthias hands over his filthy leather armor to <a href="../../html/terminology.html#fenwick">Initiate Fenwick</a>. "Sorry, Fen. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Seeker." He turns to Aury. "If you'll permit me, I will also clean and oil your scalemail, Brother."</p>

<p>The pair of Seekers next visit <a href="../../html/terminology.html#magen">Magen Eisenthrast</a>, who is quickly able to catalog and identify their finds from the crypt in the marsh. After ascertaining the general value of most items, they jointly agree to donate the electrum scarab on a leather thong to the Chapterhouse, so that it <span title="It will bring 25 royals"><sc>may be sold</sc></span> to support all the Brothers.</p>

<p>They also jointly donate eighty shiny copper pieces to the brotherhood, which will go some goodly way in fueling the Visitor furnaces and other machines of the Chapterhouse.</p>

<p>"Very much appreciated," purrs Magen Eisenthrast. "That should cover our needs through the rest of October, and perhaps two or three days into November."</p>

<p>After the mage identifies the various magical items, Matthias transforms into the kid in a candy store, who hasn't had his ADHD medication. When Aury insists that his fellow Seeker take <i>both</i> the cloak of protection and the ring of protection, Matthias dashes off to the inn-tavern, practically skipping.</p>

<p>After a few seconds, Magen asks Aury, "Was there anything else, brother?" and then glances significantly at the rolled up and tied tapestry from the crypt.</p>

<p>"Yes, magister," Aury bobs his head. "If you could take a few moments and appraise this tapestry we recovered," he unrolls it, spreading it out onto a large table. "This was hanging in the entry chamber of the crypt we raided &mdash; er, robbed, rather. Matthias seemed uninterested."</p>

<p>"Oh, my," croons Magen, once he's angled several brilliant white-light lamps onto the object d'Art. "It's <i>so</i> well preserved," he breathes, reaching for a large magnifying glass.</p>

<p>"I know!" Aury agrees. "It doesn't make sense. The entire crypt was damp through and through, and flooded in foul-smelling water."</p>

<p>"Any other details you can remember?" asks the magister.</p>

<p>"Well ... when Matthias <i>touched</i> it, the sapphire skeleton rose from the water," he supplies.</p>

<p>"Interesting," Magen coos, not stopping his examination with the magnifying glass. "That fits," he says, moving around the table and leaning over to study another corner of the tapestry, "given that the subject matter hear appears to be generally necromantic. It's clearly enchanted." He grabs a wand and hovers it above the tapestry. "Ah, as I thought, yes."</p>

<p>"What? What do you see?" Aury finds himself caught up along with the magister.</p>

<p>"It's a <i>necromantic focus</i>. I actually suspected as much when you said you found it in the Barrowmoor. The Cumerians had an unhealthy fascination with both necromancy and summoning. This tapestry served to strengthen some necromancer's spells. It probably also enhanced the durabiity and overall numbers of undead he was able to create. But it's most important function would have been to expand the total number of undead that the necromancer could simultaneously control."</p>

<p>"Good to know," says Aury, nodding. "Well, I'm not interested in hanging onto it as memento of my first robbed tomb. I have other reminders," he says, glancing at the <i>ring of fire resistance</i> he now wears. "Hmm, well, do you know who might pay a decent price for it? Some historian or wizard?"</p>

<p>"Oh I wouldn't advise leaving it in circulation in that manner," says the magister. "The tapestry is evil!"</p>

<p>"Magister, <i>things</i> aren't evil. People can be, and they may use objects for evil purposes, but the things themselves aren't evil."</p>

<p>Magen smiles indulgently. "Aury, when you're the veteran of as many campaigns as I am, then we'll talk again. The Chapterhouse can offer you ... twenty-three hundred royals for it."</p>

<p>Aury stares at the magister in stunned silence for several seconds. Then: <span title="Aury immediately spends the 2,300 royals by purchasing shares in the Chapterhouse, and so gains 2,300 XP, attaining a new overall level of 3"><sc>"Sold!"</sc></span></p>

<p>When the two Seekers sit down to supper with their guide, it is two hours past sunset. The Brazen Strumpet is at about 50% capacity in the dining room. Several villagers are here eating, as are some local miners, and a farmer who is resigned to spend the night so that the local ostler can care for his mule team.</p>

<p>For three generations, it's just been 'The Brazen Strumpet tavern'. Now, it also boasts a wing of rooms for rent, and a nicer dining room away from the coarse and sometimes even lewd talk that takes place in the tavern.</p>

<p>"Well, it's about time," Brother Jasyn grouses good-naturedly as Matthias enters the dining room. As the scholar-mage seats himself across from the guide, Brother Jasyn slides an empty tankard and a pitcher full of Padoar Stout over to the younger man. "Nice cloak."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Any sign of Aury?" As if somehow summoned, the cleric appears in the dining hall door way, scans for a second to locate his companions, then grins and makes his way over, taking a third chair at the round table and pouring himself a tankard of ale. He glances at Mattie. "Our armor will be cleaned and ready by Evensong," he informs the mage.</p>

<p>"Ah, excellent," Mattie comments, smiling as a servant brings a basket of fresh-baked bread and a crock of butter, placing it on their table. "And the tapestry. Did we find a buyer?"</p>

<p>"Magen felt strongly that it was a dangerous item and should be removed from circulation. Suffice it to say, both your dues and mine for the coming several months are already paid in full. And, he was delighted to get the cuprous," Aury supplies.</p>

<p>"Hmm. Well, I suppose that's good. I think I'm going to keep the <i>neshralk</i>. It functions as an everburning candle. That has the potential to be quite useful. What does that leave us with in terms of loot?" the mage asks.</p>

<p>Brother Jasyn finishes buttering a bread roll. "The silver necklace with pearls, the platinum necklace, and the sapphire fragment from the first skeleton we encountered. We could probably get around eight hundred royals if we take them to the right folks in <a href="../../html/terminology.html#rosen">Rosen</a> or <a href="../../html/terminology.html#sizemore">Sizemordicus</a>."</p>

<p>"I'd like to get back to the Barrowmoor as soon as possible," Mattie says. "Why don't we lock up our valuables at the Chapterhouse until such time that we're ready to make a trip worth our time &mdash; say, when we have several times that amount?"</p>

<p>"Brother Jasyn shrugs to signify it doesn't matter to him, and Aury adds, "Same. Though it's unpleasant tomb robbing in cold weather, we're less likely to have to contend with other explorers than if we postpone till the Spring."</p>

<p>Mattie nods. "We've both got responsibilities at the Chapterhouse tomorrow, but I'm thinking we could strike out for the marsh again on the following day..."</p>

<p>"Sounds good," says Brother Jasyn. The three enjoy a hearty repast and then move closer to a fireplace, enjoying its heat as they sip after-supper brandy and talk far into the night.</p>

<div class="mech">I'm going to do an experiment. I'm thinking two characters, each having access to a <i>Fray</i> each each and every round, may be imbalanced &mdash; i.e., overpowered. So, for the next little bit, I'm going to have Aury and Mattie alternate rounds for <i>Fray</i> die use &mdash; and Brother Jasyn won't get a <i>Fray</i> die at all when he accompanied the pair of Seekers.<br><br>Mattie, who has the higher Dexterity score, will get his <i>Fray</i> die use on odd numbered rounds (1, 3, etc.) and Aury will get his <i>Fray</i> die use on even-numbered rounds (2nd, 4th, etc.)  In the unlikely event that Brother Jasyn were to acompany only one of the two Seekers on a two-party member escapade, he will act on 2nd, 4th, etc., rounds and the accompanying PC will act on the 1st, 3rd, etc. rounds.</div>
