<p>We resume our story after darkness has fallen on October 23, 204 Post-Ravaging. The heroes have returned to Helix without further encounters in the marsh.</p>

<div class="mech">Brother Jasyn is ~30% of the way to his 7th overall character level, while our two Seekers are ~26% of the way to their 3rd overall character level.</div>

<p>Matthias puts the three torches he <i>found</i> under his bed at The Brazen Strumpet next to his other three remaining torches in one corner of his room. <i>This could get to be problematic.</i> This recently discovered &mdash; and undoubtedly magically-fuelled &mdash; ability of his to <i>find</i> torches, seemingly no matter where he is located, has an enticing side effect: it sometimes also causes one or more <span title="Royals are gold pieces"><sc>royals</sc></span> to appear, along with the torches.</p>

<p>"Well, not <i>this</i> time," he concedes, lamenting the lack of any accompanying coins when these most recent torches were ... <i>found</i>. But the previous evening <i>was</i> financially advantageous. And so the scholar-mage anticipates many future occurences of happily exclaiming, aloud or not, '<a href="../../classes/deeds.html#ohTorches">Oh Look, More Torches</a>!'</p>

<p>Preparing to go downstairs to join his friends for supper, he turns to the tub now full of cooling (and quite dirty) water. A servant will drain the tub while he's at dinner, then clean it. He dresses in fresh trousers and tunic, and then turns to his bed and bedside table. One of the benefits of membership in The Seekers is the sharply discounted &mdash; sometimes even <i>pro bono</i> &mdash; services from its skilled members. In this particular case, magic item identification.</p>

<p>He steps first  to the bedside table and picks up an attractive mithril ring fashioned to look like a band formed from interwoven vines. He turns it over in his fingers. To him, it has value beyond even it's artistic beauty. It is a <span title="Confers a 1-step improvement to armor class, and a +1 bonus to saving throws"><sc><i>ring of protection +1</i></sc></span> &mdash; not that Matthias thinks of it in those terms. He thinks of it as a <i>talisman against harm.</i> He slides it onto his left hand's ring finger. "Long may it protect me."</p>

<p>Turning to the bed, he takes up the beautiful midnight blue cloak found in the crypt earlier in the day. <a href="../../html/terminology.html#magen">Magen Eisenthrast</a> identified it as a <span title="Confers a 1-step improvement to armor class, and a +1 bonus to saving throws"><sc><i>cloak of protection +1</i></sc></span>. Fortuitously, the effects of both the ring and cloak stack with one another. When wearing his leather armor, Mattie willl now enjoy an AC 6 instead of AC 8.</p>

<p>Matthias had argued politely that Aury should take it, but the cleric and their guide, Brother Jasyn, had insisted <a href="../characters/mattie.html">Mattie</a> be the one to wear it. He's always been smaller and not as good a fighter as Aury. He puts on the cloak, luxuriating in its supple strength and beautiful craftsmanship. Normally, he'd have donned his <span title="Mages can spellcast in light armor in the Scarlet Horizons setting"><sc>leather armor</sc></span> before the cloak, but it's being cleaned at the Chapterhouse by an initiate.</p>

<center><img src="../../images/dividers/divider1.png"></center>

<p>At the man-hole covered entrance to the Chapterhouse, Brother Jasyn had temporarily parted ways with the Seekers. "I'm sorry," Aury had said. "But the Father Abbot permits only Seekers within."</p>

<p>"No, I of course understand. I'm going to go on over to The Brazen Strumpet and get us each a room for the night. I'll pay for nice rooms, all the amenities. My treat. I've not stayed there since they added the new wing, but I understand it's very nice. I'll see you both shortly." And their guide had taken his leave of them.</p>

<p>Down on the third sublevel, Matthias hands over his filthy leather armor to <a href="../../html/terminology.html#fenwick">Initiate Fenwick</a>. "Sorry, Fen. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Seeker." He turns to Aury. "If you'll permit me, I will also clean and oil your scalemail, Brother."</p>

<p>The pair of Seekers next visit <a href="../../html/terminology.html#magen">Magen Eisenthrast</a>, who is quickly able to catalog and identify their finds from the crypt in the marsh. After ascertaining the general value of most items, they jointly agree to donate the electrum scarab on a leather thong to the Chapterhouse, so that it <span title="It will bring 25 royals"><sc>may be sold</sc></span> to support all the Brothers.</p>

<p>They also jointly donate eighty shiny copper pieces to the brotherhood, which will go some goodly way in fueling the Visitor furnaces and other machines of the Chapterhouse.</p>

<p>"Very appreciated," purrs Magen Eisenthrast. "That should cover our needs through the rest of October, and perhaps two or three days into November."</p>
