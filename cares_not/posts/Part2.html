<p>"So, <i>why</i> exactly are we cutting out their livers?" Aury asks conversationally. The beefy cleric has his head on a swivel, mace in hand and shield strapped to his left forearm as he keeps a vigilant lookout for further threats. And the truth is, he'd rather have to fight again than have to put his hands in frogling entrails.</p>

<p>Mattie finishes carefully placing another frogling internal organ in one of a pair of <i>plast</i> bags hanging by strings from a low-hanging cypress branch. "The livers are for <a href="../../html/terminology.html#chudwick">Chudwick</a>, Cimmer the Glassblower's boy &mdash; he has <i><a href="../../html/terminology.html#viddimens">viddimen</a></i> deficiency." The mage returns to the corpse of the same frogling and begins work on extracting its heart. "The hearts are for the goblins, proof of our effectiveness &mdash; but also good eating, or so I'm told."</p>

<p>The cleric grunts. "I'll take your word for it." While continuing to scan the shadows of nearby trees and other flora, he reaches down and peels another leech off his leg, just above a knee. "I don't get it. The water only comes up near the tops of our boots, but I keep finding leeches higher and higher on my legs."</p>

<p>Mattie stands and deposits a frogling heart in a plast bag that dangles next to the fuller, heavier, bag for livers. "They're making their way toward your groin. It's their preferred dining location." He stoops over and cleanses his hands and forearms with bog water.</p>

<p>"Makes sense," muses the cleric. "That <i>is</i> where my single largest vein is located..." Mattie looks up sharply, but the cleric is dead-panning, ostensibly focused only on the hazards of the surroundings.</p> 

<p>"Well!" rejoins the mage, sealing the two plast bags. "You go ahead and luxuriate in that mistaken notion. Meanwhile, I have finished my collecting. I think these should suffice to convince our unfriendly lizardmen not to do anything untoward, at least not in the next few weeks." He hefts the bags, grimacing as the weight aggravates a cut on his right arm. "Shall we head for home?"</p>

<p>Aury turns as he hears his friend grunt in pain. "I'm hurt too. One moment..." The cleric lowers his head and closes his eyes briefly, whispering words too soft to hear.
