<p>"So, <i>why</i> exactly are we cutting out their livers?" Aury asks conversationally. The beefy cleric has his head on a swivel, mace in hand and shield strapped to his left forearm as he keeps a vigilant lookout for further threats. And the truth is, he'd rather have to fight again than have to put his hands in frogling entrails.</p>

<p>Mattie finishes carefully placing another frogling internal organ in one of a pair of <i>plast</i> bags hanging by strings from a low-hanging cypress branch. "The livers are for <a href="../../html/terminology.html#chudwick">Chudwick</a>, Cimmer the Glassblower's boy &mdash; he has <i><a href="../../html/terminology.html#viddimens">viddimen</a></i> deficiency." The mage returns to the corpse of the same frogling and begins work on extracting its heart. "The hearts are for the goblins, proof of our effectiveness &mdash; but also good eating, or so I'm told."</p>

<p>The cleric grunts. "I'll take your word for it." While continuing to scan the shadows of nearby trees and other flora, he reaches down and peels another leech off his leg, just above a knee. "I don't get it. The water only comes up near the tops of our boots, but I keep finding leeches higher and higher on my legs."</p>

<p>Mattie stands and deposits a frogling heart in a <a href="../../html/terminology.html#plast">plast</a> bag that dangles next to the fuller, heavier, bag for livers. "They're making their way toward your groin. It's their preferred dining location." He stoops over and cleanses his hands and forearms with bog water.</p>

<p>"Makes sense," muses the cleric. "That <i>is</i> where my single largest vein is located..." Mattie looks up sharply, but the cleric is dead-panning, ostensibly focused only on the hazards of the surroundings.</p> 

<p>"Well!" rejoins the mage, sealing the two plast bags. "You go ahead and luxuriate in that mistaken notion. Meanwhile, I have finished my collecting. I think these should suffice to convince our unfriendly lizardmen not to do anything untoward, at least not in the next few weeks." He hefts the bags, grimacing with a pained grunt as the weight aggravates a cut on his right arm. "Shall we head for home?"</p>

<p>Aury turns as he hears his friend grunt in pain. "You know, I'm hurt, too, actually. One moment..." The cleric lowers his head and closes his eyes briefly, whispering words too soft to hear.</p>

<p><i>Aghh...</i> sighs Matthias in relief, having not noticed the impact on his right hip until his comerade's <i>Healing Surge</i> rights the injury with an audible <i>click</i> of a socket realigning. And so the two Seekers begin slogging their way &mdash; sloshing step by mud-sucking step &mdash; back east toward Helix village.</p>

<p>But of course, things can't be <i>that</i> simple, right? We can't just spend the morning in the bog collecting some froglings organs. No. No, a pair of lizardmen, who just <i>might</i> have been on their way to confer with their erstwhile frogling allies, have spotted you. And clearly, these lizardmen have seen the cut-open bodies of those small, no-longer-jumping amphibious ne'er-do-wells. They draw up just long enough to cast spears at about thirty feet distance, and are already charging forward even before those projectiles find or miss their marks.</p>

<p>For this fight, we'll eshew mapping. It'll be a tough fight, as these lizardman cannot yet be targeted by our heroes' <i>Fray Dice</i>.</p>

<div class="mech">First, let's resolve the lizardmen's hurled spears. Let's give each lizardman a 50/50 chance of targeting the mage instead of the cleric. The heroes are fortunate: the lizardman spear hurled at Aury misses him (with results of 1). Even Matthias is missed (lizardman was two points shy, rolling a 7 instead of the needed 9).<br><br>The lizardmen close to combat range, wielding clubs and crude maces. As heroes under <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> rules, Aury and Matthias get to act first in a normal combat round.<br><br>"Let's kill the nearest one first!" growls Aury, mace raised, eyes focused on the lead lizardman who is half a pace ahead of his fellow. Matthias' <i>Fray Die</i> takes out this lizardman.<br><br>The lizardmen have AC 6. That means that in melee, Aury needs an attack roll of 12 on a d20 to hit with his mace, and Matthias needs a raw d20 '13' result for his hurled dagger to hit. <br><br>Matthias' hurled dagger sinks into the remaining lizardman's chest for 3 damage, dropping it from 16 to 13 HP.<br><br>Aury misses his attack, and a new round begins just in time for Matthias' <i>Fray Die</i> to drop it, graveyard dead.<br><br>Between the two of them, the lizardman have thirteen chroma, <i>no</i> royals, and a dozen <i>red cuprous</i> copper pieces.</div>
