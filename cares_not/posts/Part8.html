<p>1:13 am, 24th Oct. 204 PR</p>

<p>Matthias sits at the desk in his second-story room in the new wing of The Brazen Strumpet. He is more than a bit intoxicated. And, as he's noticed numerous times in the past, under the influence of strong drink he finds himself wanting to write.</p>

<p>He casually waves the fingers of his right hand over a blank page in his spellbook while subvocalizing a command word, enacting a cantrip that has taken him weeks to  fine-tune. The page of paper blurs for a moment &mdash; or was that his alcohol-fueled, late-night (correction: early morning) vision? A faint wispy outline of a pen appears and the scholar-mage begins dictating.</p>

<p>"I've been training with Rengar the Bold d'Sizemordicus, and after our foray into the Barrowmoor I now possess more than enough to pay him for his services.
