<p>1:13 am, 24th Oct. 204 PR</p>

<p>Matthias sits at the desk in his second-story room in the new wing of The Brazen Strumpet. He is more than a bit intoxicated. And, as he's noticed numerous times in the past, under the influence of strong drink he finds himself wanting to write. Truth be told, what he really wants is to sing, but the other guests &mdash; most of them undoubtedly sleeping &mdash; would not appreciate that. He sighs. Writing it is, then.</p>

<p>He casually waves the fingers of his right hand over a blank page in his spellbook while subvocalizing a command word, enacting a cantrip that has taken him weeks to  fine-tune. The page of paper blurs for a moment &mdash; or was that his alcohol-fueled, late-night (correction: early morning) vision? A faint wispy outline of a pen appears and the scholar-mage begins dictating.</p>

<p>"I've been training with Rengar the Bold d'Sizemordicus, and after our foray into the Barrowmoor I now possess more than enough to pay him for his services." The translucent, wispy pen dutifully transcribes the mage's words onto the page in a dark script, and he smiles at that.</p>

<p>A neat trick, that cantrip. It records his words in the interstitial spaces between the threads of magical energy that enchant his spellbook. So far, he's been recording several minutes of voice dictation daily and there's no sign of space running out. He moves his eyes further down the page an inch and the text above fades from view. Glances back at the top of the page, and the words reappear, clearly legible.</p>

<p>"Our little jaunt to the Barrowmoor on October twenty-third netted us enough cuprous to fuel our share of the Chapterhouse's machinery, experiments, and defenses for the remainder of the month. But supplies are still low. We'll tend to our respective duties today, and then I feel sure the Father Abbot will give permission for our absence for another day or two. In fact, he may bring it up before we do." The wispy pen faithfully transcribes.</p>
