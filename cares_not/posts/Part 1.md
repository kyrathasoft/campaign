Evoker <a href="/scarlethorizons/caresNot/characters/matthias_dSlaytonthorpe.pdf">Matthias d'Slaytonthorpe</a> pores over his map of the Barrowmaze, trying to concentrate through the mild headache brought on by much study in poor lighting. But he mustn't use any more magic than strictly necessary, for later today it may mean the difference between life and death.

As his candle burns down, he studies the unrolled map that lies before him on the study's teakwood desk, committing it to his eidetic memory. The candle dies, leaving the scholar-mage in smoke-wreathed darkness.

He moves deftly without seeing, first into the hallway where the susurration of the ventilated air breathes overhead, then down three doors, knocking lightly at a door before pushing it open without invitation. *"Aury, you ready?"*

A protesting groan greets him from a room as lost in darkness as is the hallway, as was the mage's study. "Mattie, for the Powers' sakes, it's the middle of the night, still!"

"It isn't, and I'll never become accustomed to a cleric of the Unknown One casually referencing the Powers. It is perhaps two hours before sunrise. Hardly the middle of the night." He reaches out, slaps his friend's *booted* feet at the foot of the bed with perfect precision, despite the darkness. "You *ass*! You're dressed already, chapedro!"

A low chuckle, then a thud as feet hit the floor. "Of course I'm already prepared. Today we will make our chapterhouse brethren proud, and collect enough coinage to fuel the furnace the rest of the month." The sound of flint on steel, and sparks momentarily break the darkness.

"No, no. Save it. We don't want to draw attention from the villagers," the mage insists. "Besides, by the time we get into unfamiliar environs, the sun will be up. Let's go, <a href="/scarlethorizons/caresNot/characters/auriochos_dRosenberger.pdf">Aury</a>. There's no laxity for the Seekers."

Fifteen minutes later, Evoker Matthias and Apostle Auriochos emerge from the subterranean chapterhouse, carefully lowering the warded manhole cover behind them.

"Damnation, it's frigid!" Mattie blows on his hands. Behind our two adventurers, The Mountain looms as a faint, shadowy, immense silhouette against a marginally lighter background in the predawn light, towering above Helix both physically and in the minds of the villagers.
