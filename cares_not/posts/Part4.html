<p>That night in Camp Scarface is not the undiluted celebration of the defeat of the frogling / lizardmen warband it should have been. The undead attack of the afternoon has left a dozen goblins, one-fifth of the tribe's population, dead.</p>

<p>As is their wont, the surviving goblins have posed their dead in various ways using rope where necessary &mdash; standing guard, apparently sharpening a blade, tending a stewpot. Per traditional goblinoid belief, the recently departed goblin spirits <i>might</i> be tricked, fooled into returning and reanimating the slain bodies.</p>

<p>The irony of that belief when juxtaposed with the necromantic energy that <i>actually</i> animated the attacking skeletons is not lost on Aury, and he sits staring passively into the flames of a fire, sipping cuemess. Additional bonfires have been lit around the camp's periphery, and more torches than usual laid close by.</p>

<p>"Why do goblins who have infravision keep torches?"</p>

<p>His question may be rhetorical, but Aury's friend answers. "Not so that they can see better at night. Torches are a show of wealth among goblinkind. Their use at night is either to make predators cautiously keep their distance, or else to honor guests. In our particular case, probably both."</p>

<p>Out of deference for the tribe's losses, the Seekers have seated themselves one fire aware from that of the chief and shaman, far enough away to show deference, but close enough not to appear disdainful of the honor done them by the chief's hospitality.</p>

<p>Chief Hurg is busy at his fire, taking reports from scouts, giving orders. As the evening wears on, warriors come and go from the camp. Several of them stop by the Seekers' fire from time to time, sharing meat and drink with you, a non-verbal acknowledgement of your prowess in the afternoon's combat. Occasionally, Matthias makes comments in brief, guttural goblin phrasing that has Aury hiding a smile.</p>

<p>Late that night, as a group of goblins comes off watch around the camp's perimeter and surround a fire vacated by those relieving them, Chief Hurg comes to your fire. "Thank you for your help today. I hear that you fought well this afternoon. My thanks. Our losses would have been greater if you weren't here."</a>

<p>"It was our honor," says Aury, garnering an appreciative look from his friend.</p>

<p>Hurg glances off to his left, where Shaman Spiritspeaker sits at the chief's fire. The old, wizened goblin returns the chief's gaze, then nods once, decisively. Chief Scarface sighs as he turns back to you. "Gursk and I must trust you with special knowledge, knowledge that is weighty and ... " &mdash; he searches for the Common word he needs &mdash; "discouraging."</p>

<p>Matthias and Aury come to their feet as one, the former leaning forward in concerned alarm. "Of course, chief. I am your <a target="_new" href="../../html/terminology.html#nabblat"><i>nabblat</i></a>. What is it?"</p>

<p>"The <a target="_new" href="../../html/terminology.html#urkrik">ur'krik</a>," says the chief, using the general goblin word for undead and other abominations. "Gursk foresaw their coming in his visions. He has seen they will come five times, and on the fifth, the tribe will be ... <a target="_new" href="../../html/terminology.html#zhoukast">zhou'kast</a>!" <i>Decimated.</i></p>

<p>Aury has the graciousness of a guest to keep his expression neutral despite his own religious beliefs. Matthias, waits three heartbeats, then asks, "How many of the five have happened already?"</p>

<p>Chief Hurg grimaces. "This afternoon's attack by the urkrik was the second. They came four moons ago for the first time. Gursk says there will be more moons between each visit, but that all five will come by Planting. Gursk says they come from the Barrowmaze," the chief informs you, referring to the acres upon acres of submerged crypts and tombs to be found not many miles to the southwest of Camp Scarface, in the bog.</p>
