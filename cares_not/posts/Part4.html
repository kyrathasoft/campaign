<p>That night in Camp Scarface is not the undiluted celebration of the defeat of the frogling / lizardmen warband it should have been. The undead attack of the afternoon has left a dozen goblins, one-fifth of the tribe's population, dead.</p>

<p>As is their wont, the surviving goblins have posed their dead in various ways using rope where necessary &mdash; standing guard, apparently sharpening a blade, tending a stewpot. Per traditional goblinoid belief, the recently departed goblin spirits <i>might</i> be tricked, fooled into returning and reanimating the slain bodies.</p>

<p>The irony of that belief when juxtaposed with the necromantic energy that <i>actually</i> animated the attacking skeletons is not lost on Aury, and he sits staring passively into the flames of a fire, sipping cuemess. Additional bonfires have been lit around the camp's periphery, and more torches than usual laid close by.</p>

<p>"Why do goblins who have infravision keep torches?"</p>

<p>His question may be rhetorical, but Aury's friend answers. "Not so that they can see better at night. Torches are a show of wealth among goblinkind. Their use at night is either to make predators cautiously keep their distance, or else to honor guests. In our particular case, probably both."</p>

<p>Out of deference for the tribe's losses, the Seekers have seated themselves one fire aware from that of the chief and shaman, far enough away to show deference, but close enough not to appear disdainful of the honor done them by the chief's hospitality.</p>

<p>Chief Hurg is busy at his fire, taking reports from scouts, giving orders. As the evening wears on, warriors come and go from the camp. Several of them stop by the Seekers' fire from time to time, sharing meat and drink with you, a non-verbal acknowledgement of your prowess in the afternoon's combat. Occasionally, Matthias makes comments in brief, guttural goblin phrasing that has Aury hiding a smile.</p>

<p>Late that night, as a group of goblins comes off watch around the camp's perimeter and surround a fire vacated by those relieving them, Chief Hurg comes to your fire. "Thank you for your help today. I hear that you fought well this afternoon. My thanks. Our losses would have been greater if you weren't here."</a>

<p>"It was our honor," says Aury, garnering an appreciative look from his friend.</p>

<p>Hurg glances off to his left, where Shaman Spiritspeaker sits at the chief's fire. The old, wizened goblin returns the chief's gaze, then nods once, decisively. Chief Scarface sighs as he turns back to you. "Gursk and I must trust you with special knowledge, knowledge that is weighty and ... " &mdash; he searches for the Common word he needs &mdash; "discouraging."</p>

<p>Matthias and Aury come to their feet as one, the former leaning forward in concerned alarm. "Of course, chief. I am your <a target="_new" href="../../html/terminology.html#nabblat"><i>nabblat</i></a>. What is it?"</p>

<p>"The <a target="_new" href="../../html/terminology.html#urkrik">ur'krik</a>," says the chief, using the general goblin word for undead and other abominations. "Gursk foresaw their coming in his visions. He has seen they will come five times, and on the fifth, the tribe will be ... <a target="_new" href="../../html/terminology.html#zhoukast">zhou'kast</a>!" <i>Decimated.</i></p>

<p>Aury has the graciousness to keep his expression neutral despite his own religious beliefs. Matthias, waits three heartbeats, then asks, "How many of the five have happened already?"</p>

<p>Chief Hurg grimaces. "This afternoon's attack by the urkrik was the second. They came four moons ago for the first time. Gursk says there will be more moons between each visit, but that all five will come by Planting. Gursk says they come from the Barrowmaze," the chief informs you, referring to the acres upon acres of submerged crypts and tombs to be found not many miles to the southwest of Camp Scarface, in the bog.</p>

<p>Aury sees the raw anguish flicker across Matthias' firelight-shadowed profile and feels a welling on compassion. "We will investigate!" he declares, and notes Matthias' relief that he won't have to wheedle his friend.</p>

<p>"Indeed," the mage agrees, "and forthwith! But we must return to Helix first to supply ourselves for an extended stay in the bog. We can be there by midnight, supply ourselves, and head out with the morning light."</p>

<p>Hurg sighs with a measure of relief. "We are not a large or wealthy tribe, but our hunting parties occasionally come across slain adventurers on their patrols, sometimes even before they've been picked clean." He hands over a small bag that clinks with the sound of coins. "There's almost one-hundred and fifty chroma there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;No, no, no, no," Mattie demurs until Chief Scarface holds up a palm vertically to halt the mage. "I'll <i>book</i> no argument," the chief responds, and Aury can't determine if the goblin intentionally used the wrong word to be cute or if it was an honest mistake. "No," continues the chief, "you <i>will</i> take this. For the times you've brought us village medicines at no cost, if for nothing else."</p>

<p>Our two Seekers are as good as their word. As the sun comes up the following morning, they strike out with a guide, Brother Jasyn. Our heroes set forth from Helix having each gained a level. Aury is now a Cleric1/Mage1 with 17 HP and AC 5; Matthias is now a Mage1/Fighter1 with 16 HP and AC 8. They each enjoy a +1 base attack bonus.</p>

<p><i>DM Fiat: Magic-Users <u>can</u> use up to medium armor. They cannot cast (usually) if using a shield, as many spells require both hands for somatic components. </i> This means Matthias is definitely looking for a good set of armor. Funds simply ran out after Aury's armor upgrade to scale. Matthias's <i>Heroic Deeds</i> known are now: Arcane Deflection, Effortless Dodge, Eldritch Swap, Manipulate Fate, and Oh Look &mdash; Torches! And given his high Intelligence, Mattie can now cast four 1st level spells daily.</p>

<p>Aury carries no coins or treasures. Matthias carries 3 gp he gained along with some <a target="_new" href="../../classes/deeds.html#ohTorches">torches found</a> the evening of 22 Oct. 204 PR. Note that while Aury and Jasyn have two torches each, Matthias is currently carrying five. He also has an enhancement to his mage staff that allows one end to shed light as a torch at the user's will. Total party carried wealth/treasure: 3 GP (Mattie), n/a (Aury), 8 cp (Jasyn).</p>

<p>Jasyn is an expert hireling tomb robber specializing in discovery of secret doors and traps, lockpicking, and disarming traps. His fee is three chroma per day, plus an equal share in treasure found. Technically a <a target="_new" href="../../classes/classes.html#dungeoneer_sub">Dungeoneer</a>, the hireling Jasyn has 6 HD as an expert Thief 3/Dungeoneer 3:</p>

<div class="mech"><b>Jasyn of Rosenberg</b><br>
STR 9 INT 11 WIS 12 DEX 17 CON 16 CHA 15<br><br>
HP growth: 2+2 (1st), 1+2 (2nd), 1+2(3rd), 2+2(4th), 1+2(5th), 1+2(6th) &#10168 20,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then add +8 HP bonus @ Dungeoneer 3<br>
Max Health: 28 HP
</div>

<p>The three walk along, only about fifteen minutes from Camp Scarface. "Now remember," says Brother Jasyn, "it's only three chroma per day if I remain uninjured and am not called upon to engage in combat," the Dungeoneer reminds you, not for the first time.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are agreed," answers Matthias. "If you receive any injury on a given day, we will pay an additional seven chroma for <i>that</i> day."</p>

<p>"Correct," answers Brother Jasyn. "And if I'm called upon to risk myself in combat, either on your behalf or out of self-preservation, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then we'll pay an <i>additional</i> seven chroma. Therefore, on a day in which you must fight <i>and</i> get injured, that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;<i>That day's total fee then becomes seventeen chroma, yes!"</i> rejoins Brother Jasyn emphatically, and he again takes the lead by a couple of paces. Behind his back, Aury and Mattie grin at one another.</p>

<p>"Good form would suggest you simply make that an even two royals on such an unfortunate day," Jasyn says over his shoulder as he navigates around a fallen tree, "but I of course understand that the Chapterhouse has limited funds."</p>

<p>Aury glances at Matthias who shakes his head in the negative. There is no need, at this point at least, to disabuse Brother Jasyn of his notion that the Chapterhouse of the Seekers is bankrolling this expedition.</p>

<center><img src="../../images/dividers/divider1.png"></center>

<p>Half an hour later, our three intrepid explorers are ten minutes past Camp Scarface, and are beginning to see the utility of the pairs of hip waders that Brother Jasyn insisted upon. The going has already slowed down, as bog water begins to suck at each step through ankle-depth bog. Soon, however, the annoying, muddy squelching noise will give way to the rhythmic swishing of hip wader-covered legs dragging through the constant resistance of knee-deep water.</p>
