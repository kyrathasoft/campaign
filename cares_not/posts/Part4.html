<p>That night in Camp Scarface is not the undiluted celebration it should have been, nor could it be: a dozen goblins, one-fifth of the tribe's population, are dead. Now, four hours later, darkness has fallen. Additional bonfires have been lit around the camp's periphery, and more torches than usual laid close by.</b>

<p>"Why do goblins who have infravision keep torches?"</p>

<p>His question may be rhetorical, but Aury's friend answers. "Not so that they can see better at night. Torches are a show of wealth among goblinkind. Their use at night is either to make predators cautiously keep their distance, or else to honor guests. In our particular case, probably both."</p>

<p>Out of deference for the tribe's losses, the Seekers have seated themselves one fire aware from that of the chief and shaman, far enough away to show deference, but close enough not to appear disdainful of the honor done them by the chief's hospitality.</p>

<p>Chief Hurg is busy at his fire, taking reports from scouts, giving orders. As the evening wears on, warriors come and go from the camp. Several of them stop by the Seekers' fire from time to time, sharing meat and drink with you, a non-verbal acknowledgement of your prowess in the afternoon's combat. Occasionally, Matthias makes comments in brief, guttural phrasing that has Aury hiding a smile.</p>

<p>Late that night, as a group of goblins comes off watch around the camp's perimeter and surround a fire vacated by those relieving them, Chief Hurg comes to your fire. "Thank you for your help today. I hear that you fought well this afternoon. My thanks. Our losses would have been greater if you weren't here."</a>

<p>"It was our honor," says Aury, garnering an appreciative look from his friend.</p>

<p>Hurg glances off to his left, where Shaman Spiritspeaker. The old, wizened goblin returns the chief's gaze, then nods once, decisively. Chief Scarface sighs as he turns back to you. "Gursk and I must trust you with special knowledge, knowledge that is weighty and ... " &mdash; he searches for the Common word he needs &mdash; "discouraging."</p>

<p>Matthias and Aury come to their feet as one, the former leaning forward in concerned alarm. "Of course, chief. I am your <i>nabblat</i>. What is it?"</p>

<p>"The ur'krik," says the chief, using the general goblin word for undead and other abominations. "Gursk foresaw their coming in his visions. He has seen they will come five times, and on the fifth, the tribe will be ... zhou'kast!" <i>Decimated.</i>
