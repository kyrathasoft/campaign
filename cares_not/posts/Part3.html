<p>"You have returned victorious?" asks Hurg, the chieftain of the Scarface Goblins. The two Seekers have been presented before the chieftain and the shaman, who stands by the chieftain's wooden throne. Aury sublimates his surprise at the chieftain's command of the common tongue.</p>

<p>It's perhaps ninety minutes after our heroes battled the combined force of lizardmen and froglings. Our heroes are tired and dirty, but also young and satisfied. "A great victory, yes, chieftain. And we bring you this bounty," says Matthias, presenting the plast bag of frogling hearts. A goblin warrior promptly takes the bag and inspects it for safety before handing it over to Hurg.</p>

<p>The chieftain peers into the bag, then makes a pleased, guttural noise low in his throat and reaches in, pulling out a fist-sized heart. "Ag-kirzhak, Krizhurg!" he says &mdash; <i>My Enemy's Strength, Now My Own</i> &mdash; holding the heart aloft &mdash; at which nearby watching goblins cheer and beat clubs and other weapons together, creating a celebratory din.</p>

<p>Hurg takes a bite out of the heart, then passes it to his shaman, Gursk, who follows suit before passing it on to Cere-Lukh &mdash; <i>Blood Letter</i> &mdash; the tribe's champion.</p>

<p>Aury silently offers thanks that the shared heart snack doesn't last long enough to make its way around the circle for him to sample. <i>That's all yours, Hurg and company. Inherit the strength of your foes, and all that nonsense,</i> thinks the cleric.</p>

<p>The cleric's attention shifts as a renewed swelling of cheers sweeps through the camp. Aury turns to see two goblins laboring with a horizontal pole held between them. Suspended from it is a field-dressed wild boar. The two goblins, with the assistance of a third, get the kill situated above the communal fire for cooking.</p>
