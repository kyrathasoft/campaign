<p>The Seekers are able, after shoveling a few inches of soil away, to reveal a large, four-foot diameter plug of stone capping the apex of the mound on which they stand. A few feet away, Brother Jasyn observes as the two younger men take turns, one wielding the sledgehammer while the other guards against wandering monsters (and intentional predators).</p>

<p>It takes almost half an hour to bust through the thick stone capstone and enlarge the opening to the crypt. The sun has moved appreciably along its path toward its noon zenith when Aury resecures the sledgehammer horizontally across the top of his pack, and takes a lit torch from Mattie in one hand. Grabbing a taut length of rope in the other hand, he leans carefully, looking down into the hole.</p>

<br><p>"Now remember," Brother Jasyn reminds the Seekers as he double checks the rope that is knotted around a sizable spruce less than twenty feet from the crypt opening, "we don't know how far down the drop will be. We can't preclude the possibility of injury on the descent, or that a marsh denizen or opportunistic band of tomb robbers might cut the rope and leave us stranded down there. What do you see?"</p>

<p>"Not much," comes Aury's reply, as he gazes down into the opening. "But there's definitely standing water. I can see the reflected torch light."</p>

<p>"All right," says the guide, checking his pack and weapons as he approaches the top of the mound. He draws up next to Mattie where the mage stands a good yard from the edge of the opening, on the side opposite Aury. "I don't suppose you have a spell that could get us down there more easily?" asks Brother Jasyn.</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid not." Mattie grimaces. "No do I have magic to get us <i>out</i> of the crypt. I'm afraid we're reliant on our wits and mundane means."</p>

<p>"Understood," adds Aury from across the hole. "Well then, let's light this candle..."</p>

<center><img src="../../images/dividers/divider1.png"></center>

<p>Brother Jasyn descends into the crypt first. Despite having at least two decades on the Seekers, he shimmies down the rope with alacrity and then deftly catches the burning torch dropped to him by Aury.</p>

<p>Aury holds the rope where it exits the hole and is stretched taut to where it is tied to a spruce tree. He's placed a smooth chunk of stone so that the rope lies atop it, protecting it from friction damage at the lip of the hole. Mattie descends the rope &mdash; more slowly than Jasyn but ably enough. And then it's Aury's turn. His descent is slower still. The rope moves more than with Mattie and Jasyn, but holds.</p>

<p>As Aury finds his footing thirty feet beneath the lip of the hole, he is &mdash; not for the first time &mdash; glad for Jasyn's insistence on hip-waders. The water in the entrance chamber is over knee-high, and fetid. He accepts the torch from Brother Jasyn just as Mattie causes the tip of his staff to shed a white illumination.</p>

<p>The section of the chamber our adventurers are in is ten by ten feet and brightly lit, thanks to the pair of light sources. To the north are steps that lead down. Thankfully, Brother Jasyn is an experienced dungeoneer and leads the way, so the submerged steps are detected and therefore negotiated safely.</p>

<p>The trio enters a larger chamber almost twenty by twenty feet. A tapestry hangs on the eastern wall, faded with age but surprisingly intact and apparently untouched by mildew or rot. "What is <i>this</i> depicting?" Mattie asks, leaning forward and lifting his free hand&mdash;</p>

<p>"No! Don't touch th&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Brother Jasyn's warning it too late. Matthias' hand makes contact with the tapestry and there is movement in the chamber's northeastern corner as a humanoid skeleton lunges upright from where it had been concealed beneath the knee-deep water. A jewel set into its skull burns with sapphire light as it jerks forward to close the distance and attack the tomb interlopers.</p>

<div class="mech">There is a 20% base (plus 10% cumulative) chance per round that Brother Jasyn will realize the nature of this particular type of undead. Aury has a 10% base (plus 5% cumulative) chance per round of the same realization.</div>

<p>"I've got this," Aury says, lifting his mace and taking a sloshing step forward in his hip-waders. His first swing (melee to-hit) misses, but on the backswing he connects (Fray Die) and then Mattie's wave of eldritch energy impacts (Fray Die) it from the side, shattering the skeleton, which collapses.</p>

<p>"Well, that was easy enough," Mattie observes and he moves back toward the tapestry to resume inspecting it by the light shed by the tip of his staff. "Hmm, this appears to be a depiction of some sort of necromantic ritua&mdash;"</p>

<p>The skull of the skeleton pops back up above the dark water, the red jewel in its forehead still burning brightly. A second later, the rest of the skeleton rises, and Aury groans, "Crap, there's <i>two</i> of them." He readies his mace once again. The scenario plays itself out again. This time, Aury's mace shatters the skeleton with a pair of blows.</p>

<p>"See if you can find the skull," Brother Jasyn suggests. "That gem looked valuable. I'll check down this hallway," he says, gesturing to the west. The dungeoneer begins sloshing that direction, checking each step ahead of him with a long stick, hoping to detect and floor traps.</p>

<p>Up pops another skeleton out of the water. Aury sighs, "I wonder how many of them there are..."</p>

<p>The skeleton rakes claws at Aury. Fortunately, his scale armor protects him. In a conversational tone Matthias comments matter-of-factly, "It's the same skeleton, the same one we've put down twice already. It keeps reconstituting itself."</p>

<p>"Oomph!" Aury grunts as the skeleton lands a hard blow and the cleric struggles momentarily to regain his balance. He lifts his mace again, "Great! How do I destroy it?"</p>

<p>"Beats me," Mattie answers honestly. "Do you need my help?"</p>

<p>"<i>Try to destroy the gem in its skull...</i>" Brother Jasyn's suggestion echoes to you from down the western passage.</p>

<p>The battle continues for several long seconds before Aury manages to land a solid blow on the skeleton's forehead and the gem embedded there, and the skeleton instantly falls apart.</p>

<p>"Ooh, did you shatter the gem, or just knock it off the skull?" asks the mage, bringing the light of his staff nearer.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> don't know," Aury says, irritably. "It happened fast, and there are shadows, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, feel around..." Mattie encourages, gesturing to the water. "See if you can find the gem. It may be valuable!"</p>

<p>"I'm not reaching around under there! There could be ... parasites! Disease! Or, or more skeletons. I don't exactly want to lose fingers to a submerged skull."</p>

<p>"Oh for Petrarkan's Sake, I'll search myself..." says Mattie, rolling his eyes. He pushes up the sleeve of his right arm and plunges his hand beneath the fetid water, grimacing. Aury entertains the idea of spooking his fellow Seeker, but doesn't want to arouse the dungeoneer's ire. The older man to the west feels strongly about Delve Discipline.</p>

<p>"Aha!" Mattie exclaims, standing with a large fragment of sapphire in hand. "The gem was shattered but even this fragment is worth a fair amount."</p>

<center><img src="../../images/dividers/divider1.png"></center>

<p>"Was the door trapped?" Aury asks, as he and Mattie enter the ten by fifteen foot second chamber. Even with the double illumination of Brother Jasyn's torch and Mattie's staff, it's apparent that the blue-green lichen adorning the walls and ceiling of this chamber is phosphorescent.</p>

<p>"Yes, poison needle," brother Jasyn answers. "And it actually got me. I must be getting rusty."</p>

<p>"Aury swings around in concern. "Do you need an antidote? I bought the best I could afford from Athelbyn."</p>

<p>"Nah, I'm okay," the guide assures the young cleric. "I've built up a lifetime of resistance. Plus, there's no telling how many decades old the poison is. It's potency has undoubtedly diminished with the passing years."</p>

<p>Mattie moves deeper into the room, studying the walls. When his eyes alight upon a <a href="../../html/terminology.html#neshralk"><i>neshralk</i></a>, he moves toward it purposefully. "Try not to touch anything until I've had a chance to look at it first," Brother Jasyn warns, and then he resumes probing the perimeter of the room with stick.</p>

<p>The water in this chamber only comes up to mid-calf, thanks to a riser at the door to this chamber. "What are you searching for?" Aury asks the man.</p>

<p>"Traps. There could be pit traps, animal traps, hidden glyphs."</p>

<p>"This <i>neshralk</i> radiates magic," Mattie says. "Care to check it for traps? I want to try something."</p>

<p>"Uh-oh," Aury says.</p>

<p>Mattie just rolls his eyes, then steps aside to make room for Brother Jasyn. "Looks untrapped," says the guide. "You can go ahead and handle it."</p>

<p>"You first," Mattie returns. "Just in case you're wrong."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see!" sneers the guide. "I'm not hired solely for my expertise. You also want me to be your canary in a coal mine, your ten-foot pole, eh? Sure, I'll play Trapspringer. It'll run you fifty royals each time."</p>

<p>"All right, all right. Calm yourself," Matthias rejoins, and as Brother Jasyn huffs back to resume his perimeter checking, the mage winks at his burly fellow Seeker.</p>
