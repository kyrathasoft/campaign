<p>The Seekers are able, after shoveling a few inches of soil away, to reveal a large, four-foot diameter plug of stone capping the apex of the mound on which they stand. A few feet away, Brother Jasyn observes as the two younger men take turns, one wielding the sledgehammer while the other guards against wandering monsters (and intentional predators).</p>

<p>It takes almost half an hour to bust through the thick stone capstone and enlarge the opening to the crypt. The sun has moved appreciably along its path toward its noon zenith when Aury resecures the sledgehammer horizontally across the top of his pack, and takes a lit torch from Mattie in one hand. Grabbing a taut length of rope in the other hand, he leans carefully, looking down into the hole.</p>

<br><p>"Now remember," Brother Jasyn reminds the Seekers as he double checks the rope that is knotted around a sizable spruce less than twenty feet from the crypt opening, "we don't know how far down the drop will be. We can't preclude the possibility of injury on the descent, or that a marsh denizen or opportunistic band of tomb robbers might cut the rope and leave us stranded down there. What do you see?"</p>

<p>"Not much," comes Aury's reply, as he gazes down into the opening. "But there's definitely standing water. I can see the reflected torch light."</p>

<p>"All right," says the guide, checking his pack and weapons as he approaches the top of the mound. He draws up next to Mattie where the mage stands a good yard from the edge of the opening, on the side opposite Aury. "I don't suppose you have a spell that could get us down there more easily?" asks Brother Jasyn.</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid not." Mattie grimaces. "No do I have magic to get us <i>out</i> of the crypt. I'm afraid we're reliant on our wits and mundane means."</p>

<p>"Understood," adds Aury from across the hole. "Well then, let's light this candle..."</p>

<center><img src="../../images/dividers/divider1.png"></center>

<p>Brother Jasyn descends into the crypt first. Despite having at least two decades on the Seekers, he shimmies down the rope with alacrity and then deftly catches the burning torch dropped to him by Aury.</p>

<p>Aury holds the rope where it exits the hole and is stretched taut to where it is tied to a spruce tree. He's placed a smooth chunk of stone so that the rope lies atop it, protecting it from friction damage at the lip of the hole. Mattie descends the rope &mdash; more slowly than Jasyn but ably enough. And then it's Aury's turn. His descent is slower still. The rope moves more than with Mattie and Jasyn, but holds.</p>

<p>As Aury finds his footing thirty feet beneath the lip of the hole, he is &mdash; not for the first time &mdash; glad for Jasyn's insistence on hip-waders. The water in the entrance chamber is over knee-high, and fetid. He accepts the torch from Brother Jasyn just as Mattie causes the tip of his staff to shed a white illumination.</p>

<p>The section of the chamber our adventurers are in is ten by ten feet and brightly lit, thanks to the pair of light sources. To the north are steps that lead down. Thankfully, Brother Jasyn is an experienced dungeoneer and leads the way, so the submerged steps are detected and therefore negotiated safely.</p>

<p>The trio enters a larger chamber almost twenty by twenty feet. A tapestry hangs on the eastern wall, faded with age but surprisingly intact and apparently untouched by mildew or rot. "What <i>is</i> this depicting?" Mattie asks, leaning forward and lifting his free hand&mdash;</p>

<p>"No! Don't touch th&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Brother Jasyn's warning it too late.</p>
