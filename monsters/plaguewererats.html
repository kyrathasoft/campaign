<p>A wererat (plague or otherwise) is indistinguishable from humans by normal senses. A wererat's alignment detects as evil. In lieu of other actions in combat, a wererat can change forms. It may take a large rat form or a humanoid/rat hybrid form. If already in one of those two forms, it may polymorph into the other, or resume it's human appearance.</p>

<p>When bitten by a wererat, a PC must make a DC 12 Constitution based saving throw or will else contract lycanthropy.</p>

<p>Wererats have immunity to most mundane attacks (piercing, slashing, blunt). They are vulnerable to silvered and/or magical weapons. Additionally, damage dealt by a paladin or Lawful cleric has full effect, regardless of the quality of the PC's weapon. Fire does half normal damage if the wererat fails it's saving throw, one-quarter otherwise.</p>
