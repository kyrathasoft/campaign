<p>Bugbears are disciplined combatants and particularly dangerous in groups. A bugbear can make a <a href="../classes/deeds.html#flankStrike">Flanking Strike</a> up to three times daily. These creatures are born for battle and mayhem and that they bully those weaker than themselves.</p>

<p>Bugbears are hairy humanoid creatures that are often tall and hulking. They are cousins of hobgoblins and goblins, yet bugbears love to enslave and bully them into giving them what they want. They are known to be unreliable allies and bloodthirsty monsters. They worship a lesser god called Hruggek, and they believe that when they die, their spirit will have a chance to fight alongside this deity.</p>

<p>When they have no hobgoblins or goblins to bully around and enslave, they form loose warbands led by the fiercest bugbear in the pack. Also, despite their hulking presence, they are surprisingly stealthy. They love to ambush their victims yet flee when they think they are outmatched or outnumbered. They are dependable mercenaries when paid well but they know no loyalty when their life is on the line.</p>
