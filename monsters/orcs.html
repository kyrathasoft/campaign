<p>Anytime ten or more orcs are found together, one of them will be a 4+3 HD specimen with 31 HP with 1d4+3 royals, 2d4+4 chroma, 1d4+4 copper (15% it's <i>Red Cuprous</i>). This leader will have the same Morale and saving throws as its fellows. A defeated leader orc is worth 105 xp.</p>

<p>Orcs are bullies in groups, much less confident on their own. They are quite cruel.</p>
