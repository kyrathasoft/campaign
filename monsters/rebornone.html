<p3>&#x2022; Hoard: 3d6 chroma, 2d4+5 royals, 2d4+4 copper (65% it's <i>Red Cuprous</i>; otherwise, 45% it's <i>Dark Cuprous</i>)<br><br></p3>

<p3>Experience Yielded: 350 per reborn one defeated<br></p3>

<p>Anytime ten or more skeletons are found together and fought together, when four or more have been defeated in a way that doesn't entirely vaporous their substance &mdash; as when a cleric <i>destroys</i> undead &mdash; there is a 25% chance those four will form into <i>reborn one</i>, a 4+3 HD specimen with 27 HP with the same treasure as other skeletons.</p>

<p>The reborn one forms itself of the scattered and shattered bones of other skeletons, and the formation of a reborn one is usually evidence that the particular site on which it occurs is, or at least once <i>was</i>, a scene of great evil.</p>
