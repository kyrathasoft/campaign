<p>Lizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids that lurk in swamps, bogs, fens, marshes and jungles. They may also sometimes be found in subterranean environs. Fiercely territorial, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive. The saurian lizardfolk are thought by some sages to be distant cousins of dragonborn and kobolds. Lizardfolk hate warm-blooded humanoids. </p>
