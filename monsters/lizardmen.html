<p3>&#x2022; No. Enc: 2d4 (3d10)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Alignment: Chaotic<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Movement: 30'<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Armor Class: 6 (thick scales)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Hit Dice: 2+4 (typically 13-16 HP)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; BAB +3<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Attacks: 2 claws (and special), or 1 by weapon<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Damage: By single weapon attack <i>or</i> 1d4 per claw<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Special: if both claws hit, bite auto-hits for 1d3<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Save: F3<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Morale: 10<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Hoard: 2d4 chroma, 1d4-1 royals, 1d4+4 copper (20% it's <i>Red Cuprous</i>)<br><br></p3>

<p3>Experience Fractionals<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fractional 1:</b> Lone lizardman killed before landing a hit: 0.00275</p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fractional 2:</b> Lone lizardman that landed 1+ hit(s): 0.003</p3>

<p>When calculating fractional experience for defeated lizardman, if a single lizardman is encountered, then if it attacks 1+ times but is killed without dealing damage, use <i>Fractional 1</i>; if it <i>did</i> deal damage at least once, use <i>Fractional 2</i>. If a group of lizardmen is defeated then use <i>Fractional 2</i> if two of more of them dealt damage; otherwise, use <i>Fractional 1</i>.</p>

<p>Anytime ten or more lizardmen are found together, one of them will be a 3+3 HD specimen with 21 HP with 1d4-1 royals, 2d4+4 chroma, 1d4+6 copper (25% it's <i>Red Cuprous</i>). This leader will have the same Morale and saving throws as its fellows, but is BAB +4 and it's bite deals 1d3+1. A defeated leader lizardman is worth 0.0029 experience if it doesn't score a hit in combat; otherwise it's worth 0.0035.</p>

<p>Lizardfolk are primitive reptilian humanoids that lurk in swamps, bogs, fens, marshes and jungles. They may also sometimes be found in subterranean environs. Fiercely territorial, they kill when it is expedient and do whatever it takes to survive. The saurian lizardfolk are thought by some sages to be distant cousins of dragonborn and kobolds. Lizardfolk hate warm-blooded humanoids. </p>
