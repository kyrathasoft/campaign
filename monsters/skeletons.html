<p3>Experience Yielded: 65 per skeleton defeated<br></p3>

<p>Anytime ten or more skeletons are found together and fought together, when four or more have been defeated in a way that doesn't entirely vaporous their substance &mdash; as when a cleric <i>destroys</i> undead &mdash; there is a 25% chance those four will form into <i><a href="rebornone.html">reborn one</a></i>, a 4+3 HD specimen with 27 HP with the same treasure as other skeletons.</p>

<p>Once per encounter, a cleric may target any undead within thirty feet of her position by showing her holy symbol and calling down the wrath of whatever power the cleric serves. Roll one d8 die per total core class Cleric levels the cleric possesses &mdash; or one d8 die per (overall character levels divided by two, and rounded down) &mdash; whichever is <i>greater</i>. Treat these like <i>Fray Dice</i> that can only target these particular undead.</p>

<p>A given cleric may not target any particular undead with a <i>turning</i> attempt more than once per encounter. Example: if a cleric is fighting seven skeletons and destroys three of those seven via <i>turning</i>, the other four cannot be targeted again by <i>that</i> cleric's turning attempt this particular encounter. If four more skeletons arrive on the scene, however, the cleric <i>may</i> target those four with a <i>turn undead</i> attempt.
