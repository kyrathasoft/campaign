<p3>&#x2022; No. Enc: 1 (2d3)<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Alignment: Chaotic<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Movement: 30'<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Armor Class: 6<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Hit Dice: 4 (typically 23-28 HP), <i>or</i> by level if PC/NPC<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; BAB +4, <i>or</i> by class and level if any adventurer<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Attacks: 1 psuedopod slap (and special), or 1 by weapon<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Damage: By single weapon attack <i>or</i> 1d4 via pseudopod slap<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Special: Consitution-based save vs DC 12 or <i>slowed</i><br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Save: F4, <i>or</i> by PC level if an adventurer<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Morale: 10<br></p3>
<p3>&#x2022; Hoard: 3d4 chroma, 1d4+4 royals, 1d4+8 copper (30% it's <i>Red Cuprous</i>)<br><br></p3>

<p3>Experience Fractionals<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fractional 1:</b> Lone aboleth spawn killed before landing a hit: 0.0047</p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fractional 2:</b> Lone aboleth spawn that landed 1+ hit(s): 0.050</p3>

<p>When calculating fractional experience for defeated aboleth spawn, if a single one is encountered, then if it attacks 1+ times but is killed without dealing damage, use <i>Fractional 1</i>; if it <i>did</i> deal damage at least once, use <i>Fractional 2</i>. If a group of aboleth spawn are defeated then use <i>Fractional 2</i> if two of more of them dealt damage; otherwise, use <i>Fractional 1</i>.</p>

<p>Anytime five or more aboleth spawn are found together, one of them will be a 5 HD specimen with 31 HP and with 2d4+4 royals, 3d4+4 chroma, 2d4+6 copper (35% it's <i>Red Cuprous</i>). This leader will have the same Morale and saving throws as its fellows, but is BAB +5 and it's slap deals 1d4+2. A defeated leader aboleth spawn is worth 0.055 experience if it doesn't score a hit in combat; otherwise it's worth 0.058.</p>

<p>Aboleth spawn gain advantage on rolls to resist mind influencing effects. Once per day, an aboleth spawn can emit a mucilagnous discharge which can cover  the facing side of a Medium or smaller creature, or an area of the ground/floor five-feet square &mdash; in the latter case, treat as <i>greased</i>.</p>

<p>Most aboleth spawn spend their entire lives in servitude to an aboleth overbrain. Ocassionally, an adventurer will survive an encounter with a aboleth or one of its spawn, and will later develop into an aboleth spawn partially able to hide its dual nature. This mutation can also be passed on to offspring (25% of the time).</p>

<p>Most adventuring aboleth spawn have only a single pseudopod limb &mdash; which they usually hide when in a populous area such as a town or city.</p>
