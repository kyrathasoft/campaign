<p3>Experience Yielded: 135 per skeleton defeated.</p3>

<p>No XP is awarded to a victorious combatant if the same sapphire skeleton reconstitutes itself and is defeated one or more times after it initially attacks that combatant.</p>

<p>Sapphire skeletons are like normal skeletons in most respects. However, each has a large valuable sapphire embedded into its forehead. This jewel glows brightly when in combat. If a sapphire skeleton is reduced to zero hit points, it draws itself back together in two rounds and is restored to full hit points. They are immune to fire.</p>

<p>Only the destruction of the jewel embedded in its forehead will destroy sapphire skeletons. The jewel has an armor class of 2 and has 5 hit points. Sapphire skeletons are turned as a 3 hit die undead monster on the undead turning chart. Upon destroying the sapphire, the jewel will break into valuable shards and chunks worth 100gp per skeleton.</p>

<p><p>Anytime a sapphire skeleton is destroyed via the destruction of its sapphire, there is a 10% chance a regular <i><a href="skeletons.html">skeleton</a></i> will rise from the ground in its place.</p>
