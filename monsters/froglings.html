<p3>Experience Fractionals<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fractional 1:</b> Lone frogling killed before landing a hit: 0.001</p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Fractional 2:</b> Lone frogling that landed 1+ hit(s): 0.00115</p3>

<p>When calculating fractional experience for defeated froglings, if a single frogling is encountered, then if it attacks 1+ times but is killed without dealing damage, use <i>Fractional 1</i>; if it <i>did</i> deal damage at least once, use <i>Fractional 2</i>. If a group of froglings is defeated then use <i>Fractional 2</i> if two of more of them dealt damage; otherwise, use <i>Fractional 1</i>.</p>

<p>Example: on the morning of October 22, 204 PR, Aury and Mattie are attacked by a group of ten froglings, several of which dealt injuries to our heroes before the group of froglings was killed. Therefore, we'll use <i>Fractional 2</i> and multiple it by the number of froglings defeated: (0.00115)(10) = 0.0115 is the experience our heroes earn; split between them, they each receive 0.00575.</p>
