<p3>Experience Yielded: 215 for an individual black pudding<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; 260 per bugbear defeated if multiple bugbears were fought.</p3>

<p>A black pudding was an ooze resembling a bubbling, heaping pile of thick black goo.</p>

<p>The average black pudding measured 15 ft (4.6 m) across and 2 ft (0.6 m) thick and they weighed around 18,000 lb (8.2 mt).[3] While most of these monsters were an inky black, some could be brown, grey, and even white.[5] In underground locations, these creatures appeared as dark blobs.</p>

<p>Some black puddings that manage to survive for a very long time come to be known as elder black puddings, and are significantly bigger than their younger counterparts and have an almost impenetrable outer layer of aged material. These ancient black puddings are immune to all damage, unless the outer layers are dissolved first by a very specific concoction.</p>

<p>These creatures are mindless underground-dwelling hunters and scavengers that wander and absorb whatever they find. A black pudding will position itself in a dungeon hallway like a shadow and wait for unsuspecting prey.</p>

<p>Black puddings attack by grabbing, grappling, and constricting prey directly into their liquidesque mass. Like other oozes, they secret a deadly acidic substance which quickly dissolves weapons, clothing, and organic tissue alike. When slashed at or pierced, the black pudding may split into two smaller puddings, both of which continue their efforts to consume prey; this can continue until individual puddings are too small and weak to do so further &mdash; less than 3 HD. A black pudding will eat bone, metal, and wood, leaving only stone behind.</p>
