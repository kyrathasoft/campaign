<p>Sometimes a hero is left to face inexorable doom. Rather than
succumb to the lethal poison of the centipede woman or fall prey to
the psychic domination of the blood sorcerers of Tien Lung, a hero
may Defy Death. A hero can Defy Death any time they wish to avoid
the consequences of a failed saving throw or escape a situation of
otherwise certain catastrophe. They may also Defy Death to overcome
some insufficiency of skill.
For example, the adventure the GM is running might say that only
a magic-user can decipher the glyphs that will restore the bindings
of the Demon-Prince of the Iron City, while the hero is a decidedly
unscholarly warrior. Assuming the hero canâ€™t come up with some
other clever way to bypass the problem, the GM may allow the hero
to Defy Death in order win through by luck.
To Defy Death, the hero rolls a number of 1d4 damage dice equal
to their character level, calculating the damage normally for Scarlet
Heroes- no points on a 1 and one point on a result of 2-4. The damage
done is applied to their hit points. If the character is reduced to zero
hit points then they are left with one hit point and the attempt to
Defy Death fails.
If they are able to endure the tax on their luck, they automatically
resist the effects of whatever spell, poison, calamity, or trap obliged
them to make the roll. If they are Defying Death to escape a fatal
situation then some opportunity opens up for their successful flight.
If the hero is trying to bypass some obstacle or overcome some
otherwise unbeatable hindrance to their plans, then the GM decides
how circumstances conspire to let the hero succeed. These circumstances
may not always be entirely unmixed good fortune, but they
will at least solve the immediate problem.
Every time the hero Defies Death it gets more difficult. The second
time a hero Defies Death in an adventure they roll 1d6s instead of
1d4s. Then 1d8s, then 1d10s, up to a maximum of 1d12s for each die
if they continue to push their luck. This penalty keeps incrementing
until they either succeed in their goal or admit defeat and try some
other adventure.
Only heroes can Defy Death. Other beings are shackled to the bitter
limits of their destinies and must abide by the remorseless decrees of
an uncaring fate.</p>
