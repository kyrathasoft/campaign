Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. If you succeed at a DC 9 Charisma or Intelligence check: with a musical, subaudible four-syllable vocalization in the language of the Far Ancients, the Bard breathes into existence a shimmering, hovering golden ward. It can only be dispelled by a foe who makes a DC {20 + Bard level} opposed check &mdash; a difficult feat. Unless dispelled or released prior to its duration by the bard herself, this ward endures for {Bard levels + Die Result} rounds. While the ward endures, the Bard has <i>resistance</i> to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from <i>all sources</i>.</div>

Sacrifice a Risk Die. If you succeed at a DC 9 Strength or Charisma check, you may direct a friendly creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you to fight alongside you.

<div class="mech"><b><a name="brace">Heroic Deed: Brace</a></b><br><br>Available to <i>Paladin</i> 1, Fighter 9+ or Fighter sub-class 6+, and to Cleric and its sub-classes with overall character level 12+. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. If you succeed at a DC 11 Charisma check, all allies within thirty feet of you who can hear your voice gain +{Risk Die Result} on saving throws until the beginning of your next combat turn. You may attempt this deed in reaction to an ally's failed saving throw &mdash; if you succeed in your check, add the Risk Die Result to that ally's saving throw and recalculate whether it succeeds or not.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="cleave">Heroic Deed: Cleave</a></b><br><br>When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit with a melee weapon on your turn, you can spend a Risk Die by rolling it. Unless you are a Fighter 5+, you must succeed at a DC 9 Strength check: move up to 15 feet and make another melee weapon attack as part of the same action.

This is the Preferred Risk Die Result. Choose the better damage result from your damage die/dice result and that of your ally. This is the Preferred Damage Result. Sum the two and apply it as damage to your mutual foe. If using <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> damage, add 1 additional HD of damage for every two full points that this sum is above "7". Example: 16 would resolve to 8 HD of damage dealt.<br><br>If the two of you <i>would</i> have dealt more damage without <i>Coordinated Strike</i>, apply uncoordinated damage instead.</div>

When a foe attacks a comerade within five feet of your position, or a foe that can hear or has tremorsense attempts spellcasting within twenty feet of you and within your line of sight, you may sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it.

<div class="mech"><b><a name="improvedAmbuscade">Heroic Deed: Improved Ambuscade</a></b><br><br>Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Ranger</i>, or three levels in <i>Thief</i>, or one level in <i>Cutthroat</i>.

Sometimes you're in the dungeon longer than anticipated. You'd be surprised how many dungeon deaths are the result of the loss of illumination &mdash; one mis-step and a trap, monster, or crevasse takes your life!

How would I even make use of a torch?</i> Adventurer A: <i>"Try wielding</i> this, <i>you @*!#!!"</i> When you sacrifice a Risk Die, you suddenly find three more torches: <i>"Let me check my pack</i> one<i> more time..."</i> or <i>"Oh, look, a chest full of gold, gems, and ... three torches!"</i> </div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="viciousFocus">Heroic Deed: Vicious Focus</a></b><br><br>Available only to the core Fighter class at 6th level and above.
