<p>There are four core classes in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i>. And each core class has four subclasses.</p>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="barbRage">Heroic Deed: Rage</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Barbarian</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Make a DC 9 Constitution-based check (2d8 + Con bonus + highest relevant trait). If the Risk Die result is higher than your highest relevant trait, add it instead of the relevant trait. If you succeed at the check, then for the next {8 - Risk Die Result} rounds, apply +{Risk Die Result} to all attack and damage rolls you make.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="flurryBlows">Heroic Deed: Flurry of Blows</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Monk</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. If you succeed at a DC 9 Dexterity check, make three attacks, each with a +{Risk Die Result} bonus to-hit. You may target the three blows on any foe(s) within striking distance. If all three blows land, you achieve momentary <i>ki harmony</i>, regaining 1 hit point.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="improvedAmbuscade">Heroic Deed: Improved Ambuscade</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Ranger</i>, or three levels in <i>Thief</i>, or one level in <i>Cutthroat</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Apply the Risk Die Result to your first attack in an ambush you join or orchestrate (that occurs within {your [choose one: Cutthroat/Ranger/Thief] level(s)} hours). The bonus applies to the to-hit roll and to each damage die of damage you roll, should your initial ambush attack succeed. 
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="rightFervor">Heroic Deed: Righteous Fervor</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Paladin</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it when you successfully hit an evil creature in combat. Make a DC 9 Charisma or Wisdom-based check (2d8 + ability bonus + highest relevant trait). If the Risk Die result is higher than your highest relevant trait, add it instead of the relevant trait. If you succeed at the check, deal an additional {Risk Die Result + half your overall character level (rounded down)} points of radiant damage to the foe, and it receives a penalty of -{8 - Risk Die Result} on its very next attack roll or saving throw, whichever happens first.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="shortPort">Heroic Deed: Short Port</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Druid</i> or two levels in <i>Magic-User</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Make a DC 9 Intelligence or Wisdom-based check (2d8 + ability bonus + highest relevant trait). If you succeed at the check, you instantly engage in a short teleportation (a <i>short port</i>). You reappear within {Risk Die Result} yards of the position at which you engaged this Deed, so long as you can see the destination clearly and that spot is not already occupied. You may port to a raised balcony, across a rushing stream, or behind an enemy in combat.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="steelyGaze">Heroic Deed: Steely Gaze</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Gunslinger</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Make a DC 9 Charisma or Dexterity-based check (2d8 + ability bonus + highest relevant trait). If you succeed at the check, all humanoid foes within sixty feet that can see you &mdash; and which have HD or level lower than your overall level &mdash; will suffer -{Risk Die Result} to their next attack roll or saving throw, whichever occurs first. If your Gunslinger level is greater than the Risk Die's result, use it instead.
