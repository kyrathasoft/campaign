<div class="mech"><b><a name="ancestralanimus">Heroic Deeds: Ancestral Animus</a></b><br><br>Available to Dwarves only. Sacrifice a Risk Die. Unless it both comes up "1" <u>and</u> you fail a DC 9 Charisma-based luck check, you gain a {Risk Die Result} to-hit roll bonus against giants, goblinoids of all sorts, and ogres for the duration of the current active combat in which you are engaged.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="arcaneDeflection">Heroic Deeds: Arcane Deflection</a></b><br><br>Available to Magic-User 1+ and Bards 2+. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. If the result isn't a 1, then a faintly-visible field forms around you and endures for the remainder of this round, plus the next {[(MU-levels)*(2)] <i>or</i> overall levels, whichever is <i>less</i>} rounds. The first {Risk Die Result} points of melee, ranged, or magical effects damage &mdash; whichever occurs first &mdash; that would deal damage to you each round during this duration are prevented. If using <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> damage conversion, apply Arcane Deflection <i>before</i> damage is converted. If the damage is from a spell that permits a saving throw for half-damage, apply the decrease before you make the saving throw. You cannot use this Deed more than once per round, and if you use it successfully again before a previous use's duration expires, the effects do not stack. Rather, apply the effects of the most recent Arcane Deflection.</div>

<div class="mech"><br><a name="ancientAura"><b>Heroic Deeds: Ancient Aura</a></b><br><br>Available to dwarven clerics 3+. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. Unless it comes up 1, you gain a +X bonus to saving throws for the remainder of this and the next Y rounds, and +Z improvement to Armor Class for the same duration &mdash; where X is the Risk Die result, Y is your levels in Cleric to a dwarven deity, and Z is equal to (8 minus X).</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="bardicWarding">Heroic Deed: Bardic Warding</a></b><br><br>Available to <a target="_new" href="classes.html#bard_sub">Bard</a> 3+ only. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. If you succeed at a DC 9 Charisma or Intelligence check: with a musical, subaudible four-syllable vocalization in the language of the Far Ancients, the Bard breathes into existence a shimmering, hovering golden ward. It can only be dispelled by a foe who makes a DC {20 + Bard level} opposed check &mdash; a difficult feat. Unless dispelled or released prior to its duration by the bard herself, this ward endures for {Bard levels + Die Result} rounds. While the ward endures, the Bard has <i>resistance</i> to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from <i>all sources</i>.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="biteBullet">Heroic Deed: Bite the Bullet</a></b><br><br>Available to <i>Paladin</i> 1+, Gunslinger 1+, or to a <i>Cleric</i> with overall character level 6+, or Cleric sub-class 3+. Sacrifice a Risk Die in order to add either your Charisma bonus or your Wisdom bonus to your next to-hit and damage roll.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="blessedAss">Heroic Deed: Blessed Assurance</a></b><br><br>Available to Cleric 1+. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it: if the result isn't 1, then you or an ally within 60 feet of you receives a +{your core <i>Cleric</i> levels} bonus to the first to-hit roll and the first saving throw roll made this round. If the result of the Risk Die roll is less than your total core Cleric levels, use it instead.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="Blitz">Heroic Deed: Blitz</a></b><br><br>Available to <i>Paladin/Ranger</i> 1+, other Fighters of overall level 3+, Sohei 5+, and other clerics with overall level 9+. Sacrifice a Risk Die. If you succeed at a DC 9 Strength or Charisma check, you may direct a friendly creature within 60 feet of you that can see or hear you to fight alongside you. The chosen creature can move up to its speed or make a single weapon attack even if it's already moved and/or already attacked this round. </div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="brace">Heroic Deed: Brace</a></b><br><br>Available to <i>Paladin</i> 1+, Fighter 4+ or Fighter sub-class 6+, and to Cleric 5+ and its sub-classes with overall character level 6+. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. If you succeed at a DC 11 Charisma check, all allies within thirty feet of you who can hear your voice gain +{Risk Die Result} on saving throws until the beginning of your next combat turn. You may attempt this deed in reaction to an ally's failed saving throw &mdash; if you succeed in your check, add the Risk Die Result to that ally's saving throw and recalculate whether it succeeds or not.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="cleave">Heroic Deed: Cleave</a></b><br><br>When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points or score a critical hit with a melee weapon on your turn, you can spend a Risk Die by rolling it. Unless you are a Fighter 5+, you must succeed at a DC 9 Strength check: move up to 15 feet and make another melee weapon attack as part of the same action. On a hit, you add the Risk Die's result to the attack’s damage roll.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="coordStrike">Heroic Deed: Coordinated Strike</a></b><br><br>Available to any character with one or more levels in Fighter, or with three or more levels in Thief or a Thief sub-class. Use this deed <i>only</i> when you <i>and</i> an ally have both successfully hit the same foe in melee in a given combat round. Your ally must also use Coordinated Strike this round.<br><br>Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. Compare your Risk Die Result with that of your ally. Pick the higher result. This is the Preferred Risk Die Result. Choose the better damage result from your damage die/dice result and that of your ally. This is the Preferred Damage Result. Sum the two and apply it as damage to your mutual foe. If using <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> damage, add 1 additional HD of damage for every two full points that this sum is above "7". Example: 16 would resolve to 8 HD of damage dealt.<br><br>If the two of you <i>would</i> have dealt more damage without <i>Coordinated Strike</i>, apply uncoordinated damage instead.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="coverFire">Heroic Deed: Covering Fire</a></b><br><br>Available to Gunslinger 1+, Ranger 9+, Thief 9+, Thief sub-classes 6+. Roll a Risk Die, record the result, and sacrifice it. You have rapidly fired a volley of {(Risk Die Result)/2} (rounded down; minimum of 2) bullets or arrows (depending upon the weapon used). A foe &mdash; visible within your line of sight and at range of sixty feet or less &mdash; must <i>either</i> take cover from your suppression fire, or <i>else</i> make a saving throw at a difficulty class equal to {9 + your overall level + highest relevant trait + your Dexterity bonus}. On a successful save, the foe gets winged by each bullet for 1 HP. On a failed saving throw, each of those bullets hits for 5 damage each (or 1 HD each, if converted to <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> damage).</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="dissVocal">Heroic Deed: Dissonant Vocalization</a></b><br><br>Available to Bard 1+, Magic-User 3+, Cleric 5+ or its sub-classes 3+. Your voice carries power. When a foe attacks a comerade within five feet of your position, or a foe that can hear or has tremorsense attempts spellcasting within twenty feet of you and within your line of sight, you may sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. Assign to variable <i>Penalty</i> the result of the Risk Die roll. If <i>Penalty</i> is greater than 4, instead assign {8 - Risk Die result} to <i>Penalty</i>. The foe must make a saving throw versus magic (consider it Charisma-based) at a penalty of <i>Penalty</i>. Failure indicates the foe's spellcasting is foiled, or the foe's melee attack suffers disadvantage.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="doubleThrust">Heroic Deed: Double Thrust</a></b><br><br>Bard 1+, THF 3+, FGT 5+ or subs 3+. When you attack with a finesse weapon that permits optional use of your Dexterity modifer instead of your Strength modifier in determining to-hit, sacrifice a Risk Die and make a DC 12 Dexterity check. If successful, you may make an immediate (same round) 2nd attack with the weapon, adding {Risk Die Result} to the other to-hit modifiers, and {8 - Risk Die Result) to the rolled damage sum &mdash; before conversion, if using <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> damage.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="dweomerDetermine">Dweomer Determination</a></b><br><br>Bard 3+, MAG 1+, CLE 4+ or subclass 1+. When you sacrifice a Risk Die to activate this ability, roll the die. Create a number of tokens equal to [(2 * overall character level) + Risk Die Result]. For the next {10*tokens} minutes, you can: spend 1 token to detect magic on a particular item, spend 2 tokens to determine the type(s) of dweomer(s) involved, spend 3 tokens to identify the item as per the <a href="spells.html#identify">Identify</a> spell, or 4 tokens to learn the item's lore as per the <a href="spells.html#legendlore">Legend Lore</a> spell.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="eagleEye">Heroic Deed: Eagle Eye</a></b><br><br>Available to Ranger 1+, Bard 2+, Fighter 4+, Thief 6+. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. If you succeed at a DC 9 Dexterity or Wisdom check, then when you make a ranged weapon attack roll against a creature this round, you can add the Risk Die result to your ranged to-hit roll. You can use this ability before or after making the attack roll, but before the GM says whether the attack hits or misses.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="effortlessDodge">Heroic Deed: Effortless Dodge</a></b><br><br>Available to Fighter 1+, Thief 1+, Cleric 6+/Cleric-subclass 3+, and Magic-User 9+. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. If the result is a "1" your dodge attempt fails, but otherwise add the die result as a bonus to your AC against a specific attack that has just been rolled against you. You <i>may</i> attempt this deed after the DM determines you've been hit: recalculate the foe's to-hit against your Improved AC. You may use this deed only when wearing light and medium armor.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="eldritchSwap">Heroic Deed: Eldritch Swap</b> Available to Magic-User 1+, Bard 3+. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. If you roll a 1, nothing happens; otherwise, you disappear from your current location and reappear ten milliseconds later behind one bipedal creature or construct that is within sixty feet of your original position. You <i>may</i> attack that humanoid from behind with a +4 bonus to-hit &mdash; if you haven't already made a melee attack this round. You may attempt this Deed before or after using your <i>Fray Die</i> for the round.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="enhanceEnchantment">Heroic Deed: Enhance Enchantment</a></b><br><br>Available to Bard 11+, Magic-User 7+, Mage subclasses 4+, Cleric 9+, and Cleric sub-classes 6+. Spend 500 gp in alchemical oils and three full days working on a piece of equipment of <i>Flawless Construction</i>. Make a Wisdom or Intelligence check at DC 13. If you are an Enchanter also add your Enchanter level. If you succeed, you have enhanced the equipment's existing magical bonus by one point. If a weapon, it now has +2 bonus to both to-hit and damage rolls (+3 if you&apos;re an Enchanter). If armor, it yields AC two steps better (three steps if you are an Enchanter) than mundane armor of the same sort. If a shield, it adds a bonus to AC two steps better (three steps better if you are an Enchanter) than a mundane shield of the same type. This item won’t rust, pit, fray at the edges, or otherwise show signs of aging. It succeeds on saving throws against destruction if the raw d20 roll is above 2. If you fail the check, you must spend another two days and another 500 gp (1 day and 400 gp if you are an Enchanter) and then make the same check again, with a cumulative +1 bonus. If the item has charges, it's maximum charges increases by two (or by three, if you are an Enchanter). The item is now a candidate for the <a href="#superEnchantment">Superlative Enchantment</a> heroic deed.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="enlightenedStrike">Heroic Deed: Enlightened Strike</a></b><br><br>Available to <i>Paladin</i> 1+, Monk 4+, or to a <i>Cleric</i> with overall character level 6+. Sacrifice a Risk Die in order to add either your Charisma bonus or your Wisdom bonus to your next to-hit and damage roll.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="flankStrike">Heroic Deed: Flanking Strike</a></b><br><br>Available to Ranger 1+, Fighter 4+, Thief 6+, Thief suclasses 3+, or any PC with overall level 12+. When you are fighting an opponent and an ally is within 5 feet of that foe, make a to-hit roll, simultaneously sacrificing a Risk Die by rolling it. If your attack hits, add the Risk Die result to damage dice result(s). If using <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> damage conversion, count every two full points above 10 damage as another HD of damage: 10 becomes 4 HD, 12 becomes 5 HD ... 18 becomes 8 HD, etc.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="flawlessConstruct">Heroic Deed: Flawless Construction</a></b><br><br>Available to Bard 9+, Magic-User 5+, Mage subclasses 2+, Cleric 7+, and Cleric sub-classes 4+. Spend 250 gp in alchemical oils and two full days working on a piece of Improved Equipment. Make a Wisdom or Intelligence check at DC 11. If you succeed, you have converted the equipment into a +1 magical item. If you are an Enchanter, this is instead a +2 bonus. If a weapon, it now has +1 bonus to both to-hit and damage rolls (+2 if you are an Enchanter). If armor, it yields AC one step better than mundane armor of the same sort. If a shield, it adds a bonus to AC one step better than a mundane shield of the same type. This item won’t rust, pit, fray at the edges, or otherwise show signs of aging. If you fail the check, you must spend another day and another 250 gp and then make the same check again, with a cumulative +1 bonus (cumulative is +2 if you are an Enchanter). If the item is <i>not</i> a weapon, shield, or piece of armor (i.e., it's a wand, rod, necklace, etc.), it now has a +1 (+2 if you&apos;re an Enchanter) bonus if protective in nature (i.e., ring of protection +1), or else 2d4+4 charges (if you are an Enchanter you may 'take ten' instead of rolling) that can be used to produce one spell effect of levels 1-3, or a single daily use that mimics/reproduces up to a fourth level spell effect. An item that is the successful recipient of Flawless Construction becomes a candidate item for <a href="#enhanceEnchantment">Enhance Enchantment</a>.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="flurryBlows">Heroic Deed: Flurry of Blows</a></b><br><br>Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Monk</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. If you succeed at a DC 9 Dexterity check, make three attacks, each with a +{Risk Die Result} bonus to-hit. You may target the three blows on any foe(s) within striking distance. If all three blows land, you achieve momentary <i>ki harmony</i>, regaining 1 hit point.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="healingSurge">Heroic Deed: Healing Surge</a></b><br><br>Available only to <i>Clerics</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it instead of using your Fray Die this round. A healing surge radiates from you. It affects up to {Risk Die Result} of your allies who are within thirty feet of you. Each of those allies is healed {8 - Risk Die Result} (to a minimum of 1) HP. Good aligned clerics may instead choose to use this surge to damage undead &mdash; though they get a saving throw for half-damage. The cleric herself regains {Risk Die Result} HP.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="improvedAmbuscade">Heroic Deed: Improved Ambuscade</a></b><br><br>Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Ranger</i>, or three levels in <i>Thief</i>, or one level in <i>Cutthroat</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Apply the Risk Die Result to your first attack in an ambush you join or orchestrate (that occurs within {your [choose one: Cutthroat/Ranger/Thief] level(s)} hours). The bonus applies to the to-hit roll and to each damage die of damage you roll, should your initial ambush attack succeed. </div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="improveEquip">Heroic Deed: Improve Equipment</a></b><br><br>Available to Magic-User 3+, Cleric 5+, and Cleric sub-classes 3+. If this is your first day of enchanting and alchemically treating this particular item of equipment, then create a variable, <i>Progress</i>, and assign the value zero to it. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Simultaneously, spend 25 gp on the cost to acquire and use a single day's worth of an array of special alchemical liquids to enhance and intensify the dweomers you weave upon this good quality weapon or piece of armor. Add the Risk Die Result to variable, <i>Progress</i>. If you are an Enchanter, also add your Enchanter level. If <i>Progress</i> already holds a value greater than zero, add the Risk Die Result to <i>that</i> value and assign the sum back to variable <i>Progress</i>. If the variable holds a cumulative result of sixteen or greater, you have dweomered the weapon, shield, or suit of armor into a masterwork item. If the item is a weapon, it now gets a +1 <i>masterwork</i> bonus that applies to to-hit rolls with the weapon. If it is a shield or armor, it gains in durability and will not rust, patinae, or mildew. If the item is <i>not</i> a weapon, shield, or piece of armor (i.e., it's a wand, rod, necklace, etc.), it must be made of precious materials valued at not less than 150 GP. Upon successfully improving such an item, it becomes a candidate for <a href="#flawlessConstruct">Flawless Construction</a>.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="indomDefense">Heroic Deed: Indomitable Defense</a></b><br><br>Available to core fighter class at level 2. Sacrifice a Risk Die and make a DC 9 Dex or Str check. If successful, you go into full-on defensive mode for the remainder of the round in which you activated this heroic deed, and for the next {your Fighter and Fighter-subclasses total} rounds. Your attacks during this period are at -3 to-hit and inflict minimum damage (even on a natural 20 to-hit roll), but your AC improves by four for the duration.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="intensifySpell">Heroic Deed: Intensify Spell</a></b><br><br>Available to MU 3+. Sacrifice a Risk Die by rolling it. As long as it doesn't come up '1', you succeed. If it comes up one, you still succeed if you succeed at a DC 15 Arcana check. A spell you just successfully cast that has rolled die/dice in its description is amended to use two <i>additional</i> dice of the given type. For instance, if applied to <a href="spells.html#eldritchBolt">Eldritch Bolt</a>, the bolt now inflicts 3d6+1 instead of 1d6+1 damage. If the player wants to remove <i>any</i> chance of failure, she may sacrifice two Risk Dice to intensify a spell.</div>


<div class="mech"><b><a name="ironShell">Heroic Deed: Iron Shell</a></b><br><br>Available to Cleric 3+. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. An ally you can see within thirty feet of your position gains a bonus of {Risk Die Result} to her AC until the start of your next turn. This divine ability can be used simultaneously with a Fray Die use.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="karmicBal">Heroic Deed: Karmic Balance</a></b><br><br>Available to Bard 1+, Cleric 1+, Magic-User 6+ & subs 3+. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it when &mdash; in the midst of combat &mdash; you fail a saving throw caused by a foe. On the following round, that foe suffers a penalty to one saving throw of your choice equal to <i>X</i>, where X is the number of points by which you failed <i>your</i> saving throw. If the foe doesn't have cause to make a saving throw, then instead apply your Wisdom or Charisma modifier as a penalty to one of its to-hit rolls in the following round. In the latter case, you may do so after waiting to see if the roll indicates a successful attack by the foe. If you don't have a bonus due to high Wisdom or Charisma, substitute a -1 penalty.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="leadExample">Heroic Deed: Lead by Example</a></b><br><br>Available to all adventuring classes at any level. When you roll a natural 18-20 on a to-hit or saving throw, you may choose to roll and expend a Risk Die. Add the Risk Die Result to a DC 9 Wisdom-based check. If you succeed on the check, one ally of your choice within sixty feet of you gains advantage when rolling the same type of d20 roll that round, or in the succeeding round. If there are no allies from whom you can select, you yourself instead gain {Risk Die Result} on your next to-hit or saving throw roll within the remainder of the current round or in the succeeding round.</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="leapHeavens">Heroic Deed: Leap of the Heavens</a></b><br><br>Available to Sohei 1+, Monk 3+, Thief 9+ or its non-Bard subclasses 6+. Roll and expend a Risk Die. Make a DC 9 Dexterity check. If you succeed, you are able to jump up to and including {Risk Die Result + overall character level} feet horizontally and three-fourths that distance (rounded up) vertically. Fail the check and the jump's range is one-quarter those distances. If you use this ability as part of an attack, that to-hit roll gains a +6 bonus and the minimum damage a hit can possibly inflict is 10 HP (or 4 HD if converted to <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> damage).</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="limbShot">Heroic Deed: Limb Shot</a></b><br><br>Available to Gunslinger 2+, Ranger 7+, Thief 9+ or its non-Bard subclasses 6+. Roll and expend a Risk Die. If you succeed in a to-hit roll with a ranged weapon against a humanoid foe within thirty feet and clear line of sight, that creature must make a Dex/Con saving through against DC {15 + Risk Die Result}. Success means the foe takes the normal ranged damage. Failure indicates she suffers a hit to one of her arms, drops anything in the hand on that side of her body, and makes any melee attacks at -6 the remainder of this encounter <i>if</i> she wields using that hand. The hero using this deed decides which arm is hit, if any.</div>
