<div class="mech"><b><a name="enlightenedStrike">Heroic Deed: Enlightened Strike</a></b><br><br>
Available to <i>Paladin</i> 1 or to a <i>Cleric</i> with overall character level 6+. Sacrifice a Risk Die in order to add either your Charisma bonus or your Wisdom bonus to your next to-hit and damage roll.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="flurryBlows">Heroic Deed: Flurry of Blows</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Monk</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. If you succeed at a DC 9 Dexterity check, make three attacks, each with a +{Risk Die Result} bonus to-hit. You may target the three blows on any foe(s) within striking distance. If all three blows land, you achieve momentary <i>ki harmony</i>, regaining 1 hit point.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="improvedAmbuscade">Heroic Deed: Improved Ambuscade</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Ranger</i>, or three levels in <i>Thief</i>, or one level in <i>Cutthroat</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Apply the Risk Die Result to your first attack in an ambush you join or orchestrate (that occurs within {your [choose one: Cutthroat/Ranger/Thief] level(s)} hours). The bonus applies to the to-hit roll and to each damage die of damage you roll, should your initial ambush attack succeed. 
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="leapHeavens">Heroic Deed: Leap of the Heavens</a></b><br><br>
Available to Sohei 1+, Monk 3+, Thief 9+ or its non-Bard subclasses 6+. Roll and expend a Risk Die. Make a DC 9 Dexterity check. If you succeed, you are able to jump up to and including {Risk Die Result + overall character level} feet horizontally and three-fourths that distance (rounded up) vertically. Fail the check and the jump's range is half those distances. If you use this ability as part of an attack, that to-hit roll gains a +6 bonus and the minimum damage a hit can possibly inflict is 10 HP (or 4 HD if converted to <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> damage).
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="barbRage">Heroic Deed: Rage</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Barbarian</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Make a DC 9 Constitution-based check (2d8 + Con bonus + highest relevant trait). If the Risk Die result is higher than your highest relevant trait, add it instead of the relevant trait. If you succeed at the check, then for the next {8 - Risk Die Result} rounds, apply +{Risk Die Result} to all attack and damage rolls you make.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="rightFervor">Heroic Deed: Righteous Fervor</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Paladin</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it when you successfully hit an evil creature in combat. Make a DC 9 Charisma or Wisdom-based check (2d8 + ability bonus + highest relevant trait). If the Risk Die result is higher than your highest relevant trait, add it instead of the relevant trait. If you succeed at the check, deal an additional {Risk Die Result + half your overall character level (rounded down)} points of radiant damage to the foe, and it receives a penalty of -{8 - Risk Die Result} on its very next attack roll or saving throw, whichever happens first.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="shortPort">Heroic Deed: Short Port</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Druid</i> or two levels in <i>Magic-User</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Make a DC 9 Intelligence or Wisdom-based check (2d8 + ability bonus + highest relevant trait). If you succeed at the check, you instantly engage in a short teleportation (a <i>short port</i>). You reappear within {Risk Die Result} yards of the position at which you engaged this Deed, so long as you can see the destination clearly and that spot is not already occupied. You may port to a raised balcony, across a rushing stream, or behind an enemy in combat.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="skinTeeth">Heroic Deed: Skin of Your Teeth</a></b><br><br>
Available only to the Fighter core <a target="_new" href="classes.html">class</a> and its subclasses. When you miss a to-hit or saving throw roll by a single point, roll and sacrifice a Risk Die from your pool. You succeed instead. On your <i>next</i> to-hit roll or saving throw, apply the Risk Die result as a bonus.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="soulWarrior">Heroic Deed: Soul of the Warrior</a></b><br><br>
Available only to the Fighter core <a target="_new" href="classes.html">class</a> and its subclasses. When you are reduced to below 1 HP and <i>fail</i> your <a target="_new" href="defyingDeath.html"><i>Defying Death</i></a> check, roll and sacrifice a Risk Die. Instead of slain, you are at 1 HP and will be unconscious for the next {Risk Die Result} turns. Unless an enemy executes a <i>coup de grace</i> against you, you will survive.</div>


<div class="mech"><b><a name="steelyGaze">Heroic Deed: Steely Gaze</a></b><br><br>
Available to anyone with at least one level in <i>Gunslinger</i>. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. Make a DC 9 Charisma or Dexterity-based check (2d8 + ability bonus + highest relevant trait). If you succeed at the check, all humanoid foes within sixty feet that can see you &mdash; and which have HD or level lower than your overall level &mdash; will suffer -{Risk Die Result} to their next attack roll or saving throw, whichever occurs first. If your Gunslinger level is greater than the Risk Die's result, use it instead.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="unflapWarrior">Heroic Deed: Unflappable Warrior</a></b><br><br>
Available to Sohei 1+, Fighter 20+, and non-Sohei fighter subclasses at 17+. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it. If you do not already enjoy DR 3, you benefit from DR 3 for the remainder of the round. However, if you are a Sohei, your DR for the remainder of the round is {Sohei Level + 3} or {Risk Die Result}, whichever is greater.
</div>

<div class="mech"><b><a name="unusualProwess">Heroic Deed: Unusual Prowess</a></b><br><br>
Available to Fighter 1+, Sohei/Paladin 3+, and Thief 6+/Cutthroat 3+. Expend a Risk Die from your Risk Dice Pool by rolling it, and make a DC 9 Dexterity check. If you succeed at the check, you enjoy a bonus of {Risk Die Result} to your to-hit and a 1-point improvement to your AC until the beginning of your next turn.
