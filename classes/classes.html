<p>There are four core classes in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i>. Each core class has two or more subclasses.</p>

<p>Upon attaining level 3 in any core class, you <i>may</i>, upon your next level advancement, (a) choose a subclass of that core class, (b) take level 1 in a new core class in which you heretofore had no levels, or (c) continue in that same core class by taking level 4 in it.</p>

<p>Once you exit a core class and its subclasses, you may not gain any future levels in that core's subclasses. However, you may return to the core class and gain future levels in it.</p>

<p>Subclasses share the hit die of their parent core class. Each subclass gives access to its own Heroic Deeds.</p>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Fighter</h2></center>

<p>The Fighter core class, and its subclasses, enjoy the best hit die available to PCs, the mighty d8. Additionally, the Fighter and its subclasses gain a +1 to Attack Bonus every single level.</p><br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Fighter core class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Fighter 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">When you are reduced to 0 HP or lower and fail a Defying Death roll, make a saving throw against a DC whose value is {9 + the HD or level of the monster, character, or dungeon/trap level causing the need for the save}. Penalize this save by an amount equal to the number of points by which you failed the Defying Death check. If you succeed, you stabilize at 0 HP, are unconscious, and will regain consciousness in 2d4 turns unless your foe executes a <i>coup de grace</i> against you. Failure indicates you have died.</div>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Fighter core class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Fighter 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">Once daily when you join one or more adventuring party members as a combat ally, you may choose one ally. As long as you fight side-by-side or back-to-back with that ally, the ally enjoys an AC bonus of 1 point.</div>

<br>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Barbarian</h2></center>

<p>The Barbarian subclass gives a one-time hit point boost of 10 HP at Barbarian 1. These +10 HP are in addition to the HP gained for attaining Barbarian 1 (i.e., 1d8 + Con bonus).</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Barbarian sub-class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Barbarian 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">Once daily when a Barbarian fails a saving throw that results in HP damage to his person, he may enter a Rage and shrug off 25% of the sustained damage, rounded up (minimum of 1 HP of damage suffered).</div>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Barbarian sub-class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Barbarian 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">Once daily when the Dungeon Master declares that a party member ally has been hit in combat by melee or ranged damage, or by a targeted touch-attack or ray spell, or by a projectile or scything trap &mdash; this <i>doesn't</i> apply to needle traps set off by attempting to pick a lock &mdash; if you are within ten feet of that ally, you can throw yourself between the ally and the incoming damage, taking all of the damage yourself. You can even do this if the ally and source of damage are adjacent to one another &mdash; though, if you must knock your ally out of harm's way, you will inflict 1d2 damage, to be converted using <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> mechanics.</div>

<p>The Barbarian subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#barbRage">Rage</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Gunslinger</h2></center>

<p>The Gunslinger remembers the face of her father and carries herself with the poise of her ancestors.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Gunslinger sub-class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Gunslinger 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">Even when you are surprised and caught flat-footed, you can get off a pair of shots, at -4 and -2 penalty to-hit, respectively. The Gunslinger subclass gives the PC an <i>always on</i> advantage on any saving throws versus fear and other mind-influencing effects.</div>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Gunslinger sub-class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Gunslinger 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">A Gunslinger's companions gain a +2 <i>ka</i> bonus when checking Morale or making saving throws versus fear or charm effects.</div>

<p>Gunslingers attack with two guns simultaneously and are able to target the same foe with both weapons (no penalty to-hit), or she may choose to target two separate foes &mdash; the second weapon is at a -2 penalty to-hit.</p> 

<p>Each gun has a range increment of sixty feet and deals 2d4 damage; the damage dice <i>explode</i> on a result of <i>4</i>.</p>

<p>Gunslingers can only wear light armor, and tend to prefer trenchcoats of leather.</p>

<p>The Gunslinger subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#steelyGaze">Steely Gaze</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>

<br>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Monk</h2></center>

<p>The Monk subclass cannot wear armor, as the monk requires freedom of movement.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Monk sub-class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Monk 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">The Monk is never caught flat-footed, even when surprised. The Monk's AC benefits from both her Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.</div>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Monk sub-class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Monk 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">Once per long rest, a Monk can expend <i>ki</i> to rid herself and party members of fatigue and restore 1 HP to herself and up to {<i>Monk</i> level(s)} allies. At Monk 5, she can instead do this once per <i>short</i> rest.</div>

<p>Monks can make a DC 13 saving throw to reduce falling damage or area effect damage by half upon success. If non-monk characters already get a saving throw for half-damage, then the monk suffers no damage on a successful save and half-damage on a failed save.</p>

<p>Because of their discipline, monks also may add their Wisdom modifier on saves against mind-influencing effects.</p>

<p>A monk's base armor class is 9, modified by Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers. For every two full levels in <i>Monk</i> up to and including Monk 10, this AC improves another step. Monks may wear magical rings and bracers, but cannot fight in armor. A monk applies her <i>Monk</i> level to saving throws against natural and magical diseases.</p>

<p>The Monk subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#flurryBlows">Flurry of Blows</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>

<center><font size="6"><a name="ranger_sub">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</a></font></center>

<p>The Ranger subclass gives the PC a <i>favored enemy type</i> which the player selects upon gaining the first level in <i>Ranger</i>. Examples of appropriate granularity are goblinoid humanoids (goblins, kobolds, bugbears), scaled foes (dragons, hydrae, lizardmen), abberations, or undead. Against these type of foes, the ranger adds the sum of her <i>Ranger</i> and <i>Fighter</i> levels to both the to-hit roll and each damage die roll.</p>

<p>At each <i>Ranger</i> level gained, the Ranger chooses a <i>preferred environment</i> she doesn't already have from the following list: temperate forest, tundra, mountains, subterranean, desert, jungle, ocean. When operating in a preferred environment, the Ranger adds her <i>Ranger</i> level to skill checks and saving throws, and gains a one-point <i>circumstance</i> improvement to Armor Class.</p>

<p>The Ranger subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#improvedAmbuscade">Improved Ambuscade</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>

<center><font size="6"><a name="druid_sub">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</a></font></center>

<p>Druids in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> don't cast spells beyond what they learned as clerics. Instead, they get their utility from innate abilities and Heroic Deeds. They do not count their <i>Druid</i> levels when turning undead. They can turn entities that are antithetical to the natural order &mdash; abberations, and in so doing both their <i>Cleric</i> and <i>Druid</i> levels apply.</p>

<p>When a druid wields a stick, club, cudgel, or staff, it counts as a form of magical, unbreakable <i>shillelagh</i> while held by the druid. When attacking with this weapon, the druid adds her <i>Druid</i> level(s) to to-hit rolls and to the weapon's 1d6 base damage.</p>

<p>The Druid subclass gives the PC the ability to communicate with animals at will through a form of bestial telepathy. The form this communication takes is non-verbal and nowhere near the sophistication of people's conversations. However, the druid is able to get her point across and natural creatures (non-monsters) are predisposed to have a favorable reaction to the druid.</p>

<p>Druids can move through naturally occuring difficult terrain completely unhindered &mdash; briar thickets, entangling undergrowth, boot-sucking mud in a bog or swamp, etc.</p>

<p>Once daily, a druid can shapeshift in the blink of an eye. It literally takes a fraction of a second. A druid can shapechange at the beginning of a round and still take her normal attack and movement. Upon shapeshifting, any injury or reduction to hit points is restored. The druid regains their normal maximum hit points, plus a number of temporary hit  points.</p>

<p>A druid can maintain this shifted shape for up to 1d6+x turns, where x is equal to her druid level. Upon returning to her natural shape, a druid has hit points proportional to those her shapeshifted form possessed at the time of transition back to normal shape.</p>

<p>For instance, Kelek the Antlered One is at 21/25 HP and shapechanges into a Dire Wolf with 28 HP + 7 temp HP &mdash; for a total of 35 HP. During combat, his winter wolf form drops to 20/35 (i.e., 57.1% of max). If Kelek transitions back to normal shape, he'll have 57.1% of his normal HP max of 25, which is 14 HP.</p>

<p>A <i>former</i> necromancer may recant their evil path and later in life become a druid. She must never again use her necrotic powers, or else she loses all druidic powers forever.</p>

<p>If a druid turns to the dark side and becomes a necromancer, she loses all druidic powers; however, her former <i>Druid</i> levels become <i>Cleric</i> levels. For example, A Cleric 3/Druid 4 embraces darkness, becoming a Necromancer. She is now a Cleric 7/Necromancer 1, and her clerical levels correspond to veneration of an evil power.</p>
