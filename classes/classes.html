<p>There are four core classes in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i>. Each core class has two or more subclasses.</p>

<p>Upon attaining level 3 in any core class, you <i>may</i>, upon your next level advancement, (a) choose a subclass of that core class, (b) take level 1 in a new core class in which you heretofore had no levels, or (c) continue in that same core class by taking level 4 in it.</p>

<p>Once you exit a core class and its subclasses, you may not gain any future levels in that core's subclasses. However, you may return to the core class and gain future levels in it.</p>

<a name="fighter_core"><br></a><br>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Fighter</h2></center>


<p>Prime ability: Strength; the Fighter core class, and its subclasses, enjoy the best hit die available to PCs, the mighty d8. Additionally, the Fighter and its subclasses gain a +1 to Attack Bonus every single level. The Fighter core class (not its subclasses) gains a bonus HP at every level &mdash; this is in addition to the normal gained for level increase and Constitution bonus.</p><br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Fighter core class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Fighter 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">At Fighter 3, when you are reduced to 0 HP or lower and fail a Defying Death roll, make a saving throw against a DC whose value is {9 + the HD or level of the monster, character, or dungeon/trap level causing the need for the save}. Penalize this save by an amount equal to the number of points by which you failed the Defying Death check. If you succeed, you stabilize at 0 HP, are unconscious, and will regain consciousness in 2d4 turns unless your foe executes a <i>coup de grace</i> against you. Failure indicates you have died.</div>

<center><p><b>Fighter core class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Fighter 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">Once daily when you join one or more adventuring party members as a combat ally, you may choose one ally. As long as you fight side-by-side or back-to-back with that ally, the ally enjoys an AC bonus of 1 point.</div>











<a name="barbarian_sub"><br></a>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Barbarian</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Constitution; the Barbarian subclass gives a one-time hit point boost of 10 HP at Barbarian 1. These +10 HP are in addition to the HP gained for attaining Barbarian 1 (i.e., 1d8 + Con bonus).</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Barbarian sub-class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Barbarian 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">Once daily when the Dungeon Master declares that a party member ally has been hit in combat by melee or ranged damage, or by a targeted touch-attack or ray spell, or by a projectile or scything trap &mdash; this <i>doesn't</i> apply to needle traps set off by attempting to pick a lock &mdash; if you are within ten feet of that ally, you can throw yourself between the ally and the incoming damage, taking all of the damage yourself. You can even do this if the ally and source of damage are adjacent to one another &mdash; though, if you must knock your ally out of harm's way, you will inflict 1d2 damage, to be converted using <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> mechanics.</div>

<a name="gunslinger_sub"><br></a>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Gunslinger</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Dexterity; the Gunslinger remembers the face of her father and carries herself with the poise of her ancestors.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Gunslinger sub-class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Gunslinger 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">At Gunslinger 3, even when you are surprised and caught flat-footed, you can get off a pair of shots, at -4 and -2 penalty to-hit, respectively. The Gunslinger subclass gives the PC an <i>always on</i> advantage on any saving throws versus fear and other mind-influencing effects.</div>

<p>Each gun has a range increment of sixty feet and deals 2d4 damage; the damage dice <i>explode</i> on a result of <i>4</i>.</p>

<p>Gunslingers can only wear light armor, and tend to prefer trenchcoats of leather.</p>

<p>When a Gunslinger rolls a natural "1" attack roll, one of her <i>resolvers</i> has had a misfire. That weapon cannot be used again until cleared, which is something the Gunslinger must do outside of combat.</p>

<p>The Gunslinger subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#steelyGaze">Steely Gaze</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>











<a name="monk_sub"><br></a>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Monk</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Dexterity & Wisdom; the Monk subclass cannot wear armor, as the monk requires freedom of movement.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Monk sub-class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Monk 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">At Monk 3, the Monk is never caught flat-footed, even when surprised. The Monk's AC benefits from both her Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers.</div>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Monk sub-class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Monk 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">Once per long rest, a Monk can expend <i>ki</i> to rid herself and party members of fatigue and restore 1 HP to herself and up to {<i>Monk</i> level(s)} allies. At Monk 5, she can instead do this once per <i>short</i> rest.</div>

<p>Monks can make a DC 13 saving throw to reduce falling damage or area effect damage by half upon success. If non-monk characters already get a saving throw for half-damage, then the monk suffers no damage on a successful save and half-damage on a failed save.</p>

<p>Because of their discipline, monks also may add their Wisdom modifier on saves against mind-influencing effects.</p>

<p>A monk's base armor class is 9, modified by Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers. For every two full levels in <i>Monk</i> up to and including Monk 10, this AC improves another step. Monks may wear magical rings and bracers, but cannot fight in armor. A monk applies her <i>Monk</i> level to saving throws against natural and magical diseases.</p>

<p>The Monk subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#flurryBlows">Flurry of Blows</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>











<a name="ranger_sub"><br></a>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Ranger</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Dexterity & Wisdom; the Ranger subclass gives the PC +10 feet of movement in dungeons, and +20 feet outdoors. Rangers get <i>advantage</i> on any tracking or survival checks.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Ranger sub-class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Ranger 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">At Ranger 3, against her <i>favored enemy type</i>, the ranger adds her <i>Ranger</i> levels to the to-hit roll and both her <i>Ranger</i> and <i>Fighter</i> levels to the sum of the rolled damage dice, before conversion using <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> rules. If the converted damage is 4, the Ranger then adds her Wisdom or Strength modifier to the damage.</div>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Ranger sub-class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Ranger 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">If a party Ranger participates in the planning and execution of an ambush, the Ranger's allies receive a +1 bonus on d20 rolls and 2d8 checks during the round in which the ambush is launched.</div>

<p>Examples of appropriate granularity for <i>favored enemy type</i> are goblinoid humanoids (goblins, kobolds, bugbears), scaled foes (dragons, hydrae, lizardmen), abberations, or undead.</p>

<p>At each <i>Ranger</i> level gained, the Ranger chooses a <i>preferred environment</i> she doesn't already have from the following list: temperate forest, tundra, mountains, subterranean, desert, jungle, ocean. When operating in a preferred environment, the Ranger adds her <i>Ranger</i> level to skill checks and saving throws, and gains a one-point <i>circumstance</i> improvement to Armor Class.</p>

<p>The Ranger subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#improvedAmbuscade">Improved Ambuscade</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>









<a name="cleric_core"><br></a><br>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Cleric</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Wisdom; the Cleric is the voice and tool of a Power, be it a power of Good or Evil. Clerics can <i>detect good and evil</i> at will. They can also <i>Read Magic</i> at will. Given sufficient time and materials &mdash; the latter being expensive &mdash; a cleric can create spell scrolls of clerical spells that are within the cleric's knowledge and power.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Cleric core class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Cleric 3:</p></center></p>

<div class="mech">At Cleric 3, a Good cleric gains the ability to <i>remove curse</i> by sacrificing a Risk Die. An Evil cleric instead gains the ability to <i>bestow curse</i> in the same manner. A bestowed curse successfully resisted via a saving throw still imposes a -1 penalty to AC and to-hit for two rounds; a failed save imposes double the penalties for a full turn. These effects require physical contact. Clerics can use these abilities innately up to twice between every long rest.<br><br>Clerics of any alignment can <i>neutralize poison</i> or <i>cure disease</i> once daily by sacrificing two Risk Dice.</div>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Cleric core class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Cleric 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">A cleric who is part of an adventuring party or other small group may, once per round, cast the <i>Boon</i> orizon if no actions other than movement and Fray Die are undertaken. The <i>Boon</i> recipient must be within the cleric's line of sight and within sixty feet of the cleric. The recipient regains 1 HP and any detrimental status effects are suspended for the next {Cleric's level} rounds.</div>




<a name="druid_sub"><br></a>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Druid</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Wisdom; Druids in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> don't cast spells beyond what they learned as clerics. Instead, they get their utility from innate abilities and Heroic Deeds.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Druid sub-class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Druid 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">At Druid 3, a druid gains <i>resistance to fire</i>, both mundane and magical.</div>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Druid sub-class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Druid 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">A party containing a Druid can camp in the wilderness without fear of natural creatures of the area. Indeed, natural predators of the area will attempt to protect the druid. If the party's Druid is Druid 3 or higher, party members within ten feet of the druid enjoy a +1 <i>druidic</i> bonus to saving throws versus fire.</div>

<p>Druids do not count their <i>Druid</i> levels when turning undead. They can turn entities that are antithetical to the natural order &mdash; abberations, and in so doing both their <i>Cleric</i> and <i>Druid</i> levels apply.</p>

<p>When a druid wields a stick, club, cudgel, or staff, it counts as a form of magical, unbreakable <i>shillelagh</i> while held by the druid. When attacking with this weapon, the druid adds her <i>Druid</i> level(s) to to-hit rolls and to the weapon's 1d6 base damage.</p>

<p>The Druid subclass gives the PC the ability to communicate with animals at will through a form of bestial telepathy. The form this communication takes is non-verbal and nowhere near the sophistication of people's conversations. However, the druid is able to get her point across and natural creatures (non-monsters) are predisposed to have a favorable reaction to the druid.</p>

<p>Druids can move through naturally occuring difficult terrain completely unhindered &mdash; briar thickets, entangling undergrowth, boot-sucking mud in a bog or swamp, etc.</p>

<p>Once daily, a druid can shapeshift in the blink of an eye. It literally takes a fraction of a second. A druid can shapechange at the beginning of a round and still take her normal attack and movement. Upon shapeshifting, any injury or reduction to hit points is restored. The druid regains their normal maximum hit points, plus a number of temporary hit  points.</p>

<p>A druid can maintain this shifted shape for up to 1d6+x turns, where x is equal to her druid level. Upon returning to her natural shape, a druid has hit points proportional to those her shapeshifted form possessed at the time of transition back to normal shape.</p>

<p>For instance, Kelek the Antlered One is at 21/25 HP and shapechanges into a Dire Wolf with 28 HP + 7 temp HP &mdash; for a total of 35 HP. During combat, his winter wolf form drops to 20/35 (i.e., 57.1% of max). If Kelek transitions back to normal shape, he'll have 57.1% of his normal HP max of 25, which is 14 HP.</p>

<center><table border=1 background="beige">
<tr bgcolor="beige"><th align="center" colspan=5><font size="4">Druidic Shapeshifting</font></th></tr>
<tr><td><b><center>Level</center></b></td><td><b><center>Form 1</center></b></td><td><b><center>Form 2</center></b></td><td><b><center>Form 3</center></b></td><td><b><center>Additional Temp HP</center></b></td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Druid 1</i> or overall 4+</td><td>Falcon</td><td>Gar</td><td>Wolf</td><td>+2d8</tr>

</table></center>

<p>A <i>former</i> necromancer may recant their evil path and later in life become a druid. She must never again use her necrotic powers, or else she loses all druidic powers forever.</p>

<p>If a druid turns to the dark side and becomes a necromancer, she loses all druidic powers; however, her former <i>Druid</i> levels become <i>Cleric</i> levels. For example, A Cleric 3/Druid 4 embraces darkness, becoming a Necromancer. She is now a Cleric 7/Necromancer 1, and her clerical levels correspond to veneration of an evil power.</p>

<a name="paladin_sub"><br></a>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Paladin</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Charisma; Paladins in <sc><b>Scarlet Horizons</b></sc> are a sub-class of cleric rather than of fighter. But though they use the Cleric's d6 hit die, Paladins enjoy a fighter's base attack bonus. A paladin has the ability to <i>Smite</i> evil creatures. When attacking an evil foe, a paladin adds her <i>Paladin</i> level to other attack roll modifiers, and on a successful hit deals weapon damage dice + Paladin levels + her Charisma modifier.</p>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Paladin sub-class <i>personal</i> boon</b> attained at Paladin 3:</p></center>

<div class="mech">At Paladin 3, the paladin gains the <i>Lay on Hands</i> ability. Between long rests, the paladin can lay hands on herself or an ally and restore up to {Paladin level x 5} HP in total. A 3rd level Paladin could spread these 15 HP among multiple targets if desired.</div>

<br><br><br>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Paladin sub-class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Paladin 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">When an adventuring party containing a paladin fights evil creatures, the paladin and his allies are protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against their targets. The targets also can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the targets are already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the targets have advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect. The duration of this effect on the paladin's allies, per encounter, is {<i>Paladin</i> Level(s) rounds}. The paladin herself enjoys this protection perpetually.</div>

<a name="sohei_sub"><br></a>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Sohei</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Wisdom; the Sohei is a warrior-priest with the d6 hit-die of a cleric, but the base attack bonus of a fighter. Sohei can use all types of armor, disdain shields, and their special training in the naginata and kanabo (maul) allows Sohei to inflict the full 1d10 damage die with those weapons. Sohei have <i>advantage</i> on all Constitution checks.</p>

<a name="thief_core"><br></a>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Thief</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Dexterity & Charisma; the Thief is as skilled with her tongue as she is with the blade. Anyone can move quietly, but Thieves can move <i>silently</i>. Anyone can hide in darkness, but Thieves can hide in <i>shadows</i>. Anyone can climb rough surfaces, but Thieves can climb <i>sheer</i> surfaces.</p>

<br><br><br>

<div class="mech">At third level the core Thief gains Improved Evasion whenever awake, standing, and unhindered in any way. Traps and spell effects against which the thief successfully saves deal <i>no damage</i>. But even on a failed save, the thief only suffers <i>half damage</i>. Due to occupational exposure, the thief who reaches level 3 of the core Thief class also enjoys a +2 <i>habituation</i> bonus to saves against poisons.</div>

<center><font size="6">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</font></center>

<center><p><b>Thief core class <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Thief 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">A party with a thief has a trap-finder/disarmer, someone who can scout ahead silently, and someone with a chance of being able to use arcane and clerical scrolls when there isn't a magic-user or cleric around. But most importantly is the core Thief ability to <i>Circle</i> During combat: the thief takes advantage of distractions his allies provide in order to circle around behind a foe and attack. This isn't a backstab. It doesn't matter if the foe knows the Thief is Circling. The thief gets a +2 to-hit bonus from behind the foe, and upon a successful hit inflicts double damage. If for some reason the target is unwary or unsuspecting, the to-hit bonus rises to +4 and triple damage is inflicted.</div>

<p>A thief's Circle damage applies to <i>any</i> target, even non-humanoids (think <i>dragons</i>) or non-living humanoids (undead/golems). Thieves do <i>not</i> get triple damage against such foes, however.</p>

<p>Sneak/ambush damage for triple the rolled value can only happen if the thief is unencumbered and wearing light or no armor. Circle damage, however, is possible while lightly encumbered and even if the Thief is wearing medium (though not heavy) armor.</p>








<a name="bard_sub"><br></a>

<center><img src="../images/dividers/divider1.png"><br><h2>Bard</h2></center>

<p>Prime ability: Intelligence & Charisma; the Bard is a subclass of the Thief core class. The bard is even more skilled with her tongue than with the blade.

<center><p><b>Dungeoneer <i>party</i> boon</b> attained at Dungeoneer 1:</p></center>

<div class="mech">A Dungeoneer has a preternatural sixth sense about traps, waiting assassins, imminent ambushes, and environmental hazards that goes even beyond her normal five senses. As long as she hasn't expended the last of her daily Heroic Deeds dice, the Dungeoneer can &mdash; if afforded the opportunity by other party members &mdash; correctly intuit the presence of a trap, mundane or magical, with 90% accuracy (roll separately for individual traps and other hazards).</div>
