<p>There are four core classes in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i>. Each core class has two or more subclasses.</p>

<p>Upon attaining level 3 in any core class, you must upon your next advancement either choose a subclass of that core class, or else take level 1 in a new core class in which you heretofore had no levels.</p>

<p>Once you exit a core class and its subclasses, you may not gain any future levels in that core's subclasses.</p> 

<p>So it's perfectly okay to have the following progression, as long as you're certain that you're okay with never gaining further cleric subclass levels: Cleric 3/Paladin 6/Fighter 1. Or, you might begin your adventuring career as a rogue but wind up a gunslinger: Thief 3/Fighter 3/Gunslinger 2.</p>

<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Paladin<br></p3>
<p3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x25E6; Sohei<br></p3>

<p>As long as you stay within a core class, you may switch freely among its subclasses as you advance in levels. For instance, you might have the following progression:</p>

<p>Cleric 3/Paladin 5/Sohei 4</p>

<p>Subclasses share the hit die of their parent core class. Each subclass gives access to its own Heroic Deeds.</p>

<p>The Fighter core class, and its subclasses, enjoy the best hit die available to PCs, the mighty d8. Additionally, the Fighter and its subclasses gains a +1 to Attack Bonus every single level.</p>

<p>The Barbarian subclass gives a one-time hit point boost when a PC takes level 1 in it. Not only does the PC gain (1d8 + Con bonus), but also two additional hit points for each overall character level. Thus, Rorg, a Fighter 3/Barbarian 1 who has just attained his first level in Barbarian, had 25 HP before leveling, gains 6 more upon gaining Barbarian 1 (rolled 4 on d8, plus two more for Con bonus) for a total of 31, then gains an additional two HP per overall character level (2x4), bringing maximum HP to 39.</p>

<p>The Barbarian subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#barbRage">Rage</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>

<center><font size="6"><a name="gunslinger_sub">&#x25E6;&#x25E6;&#x25E6;</a></font></center>

<p>The Gunslinger subclass gives the PC an <i>always on</i> advantage on any saving throws versus fear and other mind-influencing effects, for the Gunslinger remembers the face of her father and carries herself with the poise of her ancestors.</p>

<p>Gunslingers attack with two guns simultaneously and are able to target the same target with both weapons (no penalty to-hit), or different targets &mdash; the second weapon is at a -2 penalty to-hit.</p> 

<p>Each gun has a range increment of sixty feet and deals 2d4 damage; the damage dice <i>explode</i> on a result of <i>4</i>.</p>

<p>The Gunslinger subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#steelyGaze">Steely Gaze</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>

<p>The Monk subclass cannot wear armor, as the monk requires freedom of movement.</p>

<p>Monks can make a DC 13 saving throw to reduce falling damage or area effect damage by half upon success. If non-monk characters already get a saving throw for half-damage, then the monk suffers no damage on a successful save and half-damage on a failed save.</p>

<p>Because of their discipline, monks also may add their Wisdom modifier on saves against mind-influencing effects.</p>

<p>A monk's base armor class is 9, modified by their Dexterity modifier. For every two full levels in <i>Monk</i>, this AC improves another step. Monks may wear magical rings and bracers, but cannot fight in armor. A monk applies her <i>Monk</i> level to saving throws against natural and magical diseases.</p>

<p>The Monk subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#flurryBlows">Flurry of Blows</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>

<p>The Ranger subclass gives the PC a <i>favored enemy type</i> which the player selects upon gaining the first level in <i>Ranger</i>. Examples of appropriate granularity are goblinoid humanoids (goblins, kobolds, bugbears), scaled foes (dragons, hydrae, lizardmen), abberations, or undead. Against these type of foes, the ranger adds the sum of her <i>Ranger</i> and <i>Fighter</i> levels to both the to-hit roll and each damage die roll.</p>

<p>At each <i>Ranger</i> level gained, the Ranger chooses a <i>preferred environment</i> she doesn't already have from the following list: temperate forest, tundra, mountains, subterranean, desert, jungle, ocean. When operating in a preferred environment, the Ranger adds her <i>Ranger</i> level to skill checks and saving throws, and gains a one-point <i>circumstance</i> improvement to Armor Class.</p>

<p>The Ranger subclass gives access to the <i><a href="deeds.html#improvedAmbuscade">Improved Ambuscade</a></i> Heroic Deed.</p>

<p>Druids in <i>Scarlet Horizons</i> don't cast spells beyond what they learned as clerics. Instead, they get their utility from innate abilities and Heroic Deeds. They do not count their <i>Druid</i> levels when turning undead. They can turn entities that are antithetical to the natural order &mdash; abberations, and in so doing both their <i>Cleric</i> and <i>Druid</i> levels apply.</p>

<p>When a druid wields a stick, club, cudgel, or staff, it counts as a form of magical, unbreakable <i>shillelagh</i> while held by the druid. When attacking with this weapon, the druid adds her <i>Druid</i> level(s) to to-hit rolls and to the weapon's 1d6 base damage.</p>

<p>The Druid subclass gives the PC the ability to communicate with animals at will through a form of bestial telepathy. The form this communication takes is non-verbal and nowhere near the sophistication of people's conversations. However, the druid is able to get her point across and natural creatures (non-monsters) are predisposed to have a favorable reaction to the druid.</p>

<p>Druids can move through naturally occuring difficult terrain completely unhindered &mdash; briar thickets, entangling undergrowth, boot-sucking mud in a bog or swamp, etc.</p>

<p>Once daily, a druid can shapeshift in the blink of an eye. It literally takes a fraction of a second. A druid can shapechange at the beginning of a round and still take her normal attack and movement. Upon shapeshifting, any injury or reduction to hit points is restored. The druid regains their normal maximum hit points, plus a number of temporary hit  points.</p>

<p>A druid can maintain this shifted shape for up to 1d6+x turns, where x is equal to her druid level. Upon returning to her natural shape, a druid has hit points proportional to those her shapeshifted form possessed at the time of transition back to normal shape.</p>

<p>For instance, Kelek the Antlered One is at 21/25 HP and shapechanges into a Dire Wolf with 28 HP + 7 temp HP &mdash; for a total of 35 HP. During combat, his winter wolf form drops to 20/35 (i.e., 57.1% of max). If Kelek transitions back to normal shape, he'll have 57.1% of his normal HP max of 25, which is 14 HP.</p>

<p>A <i>former</i> necromancer may recant their evil path and later in life become a druid. She must never again use her necrotic powers, or else she loses all druidic powers forever.</p>

<p>If a druid turns to the dark side and becomes a necromancer, she loses all druidic powers; however, her former <i>Druid</i> levels become <i>Cleric</i> levels. For example, A Cleric 3/Druid 4 embraces darkness, becoming a Necromancer. She is now a Cleric 7/Necromancer 1, and her clerical levels correspond to veneration of an evil power.</p>
