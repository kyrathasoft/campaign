<p><b>Burning Hands</b><p>

<p>As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

<a name="dancingLights">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Dancing Lights</b></p>

<p>Enchantment cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10- foot radius.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>

<hr>

<a name="detectMagic">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Detect Magic</b></p>

<p>For the ten-minute duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.</p>

<hr>

<a name="eldritchBolt">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Eldritch Bolt</b></p>

<p>A bolt of eldritch force unerringly strikes your intended target that is within ninety feet of your position, and for whom you have a clear line of sight. The bolt inflicts 1d6+1 damage, no saving throw. This spell can only target corporeal creatures or objects. It would not, for instance, be useful against a ghost. For every odd level attained beyond 1st in the magic-user/wizard class (or subclass), an additional bolt can be produced. It can target the same or a different target.</p>

<hr>

<a name="identify">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Identify</b></p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 minute<br>
Range: Touch<br>
Target: One object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell<br>
Components: V S M (A pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)<br>
Duration: Instantaneous<br>
Classes: Bard, Wizard<br>
You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.<br><br>
If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.</p>

<hr>

<a name="legendlore">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Legend Lore</b></p>

<p>Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named isn't of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing, the more precise and detailed the information you receive is.</p>

<p>The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information: â€œWoe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the lips."</p>

<hr>

<a name="levitate">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Levitate</b></p>

<p>One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.</p>

<hr>

<a name="mageArmor">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Mage Armor</b></p>

<p>You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 7, modified by Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action. Duration is 8 hours or until spell is released by the caster. If the mage is wearing light armor, then <i>Mage Armor</i> improves AC by one step, after all other modifiers are considered.</p>

<hr>

<a name="mageHand">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Mage Hand</b></p>

<p>Conjuration cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: 1 minute</p>

<p>A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again. You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.</p>

<hr>

<a name="viciousMockery">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Vicious Mockery</b></p>

<p>Evocation cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 60 feet<br>
Components: V<br>
Duration: Instantaneous</p>

<p>You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>

<hr>


<a name="minorIllusion">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Minor Illusion</b><p>

<p>Illusion cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)<br>
Duration: 1 minute<p>

<p>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. If you create an image of an object--such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest &mdash; it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>

<hr>

<a name="sleep">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Sleep</b></p>

<p>This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creatureâ€™s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creatureâ€™s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed arenâ€™t affected by this spell. Creatures of 4 HD or less get no saving throw; creatures with greater levels or HD than 4, but who are less than or equal to the caster's level get a saving throw to avoid the effect, and creatures with levels or hit dice equal to or greater than the caster's overall level successfully resist this spell's effect.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

<hr>

<a name="trueStrike">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>True Strike</b><p>
<p>Divination cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 round</p>

<p>You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target's defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn't ended.</p>
