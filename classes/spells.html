<p><b>Dancing Lights</b></p>

<p>Enchantment cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 120 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10- foot radius.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>

<p><b>Mage Hand</b></p>

<p>Conjuration cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: 1 minute</p>

<p>A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again. You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.</p>

<p><b>Vicious Mockery</b></p>

<p>Evocation cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 60 feet<br>
Components: V<br>
Duration: Instantaneous</p>

<p>You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.
This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>

<a name="minorIllusion">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>Minor Illusion</b><p>

<p>Illusion cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)<br>
Duration: 1 minute<p>

<p>You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. If you create an image of an object--such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest &mdash; it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>

<a name="trueStrike">&nbsp;</a><br>

<p><b>True Strike</b><p>
<p>Divination cantrip</p>

<p>Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 round</p>

<p>You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target's defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn't ended.</p>
