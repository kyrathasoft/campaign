<i>Blacktooth</i>: Built in the years 21 to 32 PR (Post-Ravaging), this small fortress was erected on the site where Kurg Blacktooth slew the Shou witch-priestess Golnadeg Grue-Spitter and her elite bugbear unit, putting an end to the swath of destruction they had carved through Smokeshadow, Dolecherry, and Silent Diamond. Blacktooth joined Smokeshadow and Moonwall in fielding men-at-arms to patrol the Farground Road against incursions by gnoll, ogres, and occasional giants from the surrounding hills.
