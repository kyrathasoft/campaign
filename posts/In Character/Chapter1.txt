Fall, 204 PR (<i>Post-Ravaging</i>)

Midafternoon finds you at the end of a long day's trek from the village of Dartscale to Wizard's Tower. Fortunately, you paused long enough at Ashbridge to do some fishing. So now, as you and perhaps a dozen other folk local to Stigrix stand around waiting for Tauste to come out on his balcony, you are managing to keep warm as you grill your catch and brew a tin of <i><a href="https://wiki.rpol.net/78448">Henneth</a></i> over a small cookfire.

You fancy your chances of being picked. The old man always has odd jobs for young hands and strong backs. One of your childhood friends from Padoar tosses his head at you from across the yard, then slinks insouciantly over to you and your fire, a grin on his face. A trio of older men nearby are passing an earthenware jug among themselves and grumbling about the wait.
