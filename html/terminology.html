The church of St. Ygg holds political and administrative control of the town. The clerics both lead and employ men-at-arms to defend the town&apos;s wooden palisade. They also serve as civil and religious authorities. In addition, Eastdale is the religious center of Middenmark and provides everything from the training of new adepts to barracking a small company of Red Bannermen, St. Ygg&apos;s order of sacred paladins. Due to ecclesiastical law, Eastdale has a reputation as a stern and somber place.

Population: 649<br>

A village on the far western edge of the Middenmark, Westkeep draws its name from a single watchtower-monastery built by the local populace and the clerics of St. Ygg. The watchtower serves as a means of protection but also a place of study and training for young apprentice clerics. The door to the watchtower is 20 feet above the ground and accessed by a temporary wooden staircase. In the event of an attack the populace retreats to the watchtower and the staircase can be destroyed or burned to ensure their safety. The Red Laws are observed in Westkeep, but not as strictly as Eastdale.</p>
