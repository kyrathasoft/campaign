Aury sells studded leather for 17 GP (Aury 157.2846 GP)<br>
Aury buys scale armor for 60 GP (Aury 97.2846 GP)<br>
Aury buys 3 doses of the alchemist Athelbyn's most potent poison antidote (67.0 GP)<br>
Aury buys a scroll with 3 remove curse spells @ 10 GP ea. (37.0 GP)<br>
Aury buys a scroll with 2 cure disease spells @ 15 GP ea. (7.0 GP)<br>
Aury buys a spellbook (the vendor takes a bath) @ 7 GP<br>
<br>
Mattie buys an enchanted orichalcum band for his quarterstaff<br>
Mattie and Aury are flat broke, even after accepting minor funding from their chapterhouse

</p>

<p>Aury chooses to gain his 1st level in Magic-User as he attains overall character level 02. He gains 2 more HP for the level in Mage, and two more for a 17 Constitution's bonus, for a total HP change from 13 max to 17 max.</p>

<p>Aury learns a magic-user spell: Eldritch Bolt, which can produce an eldritch bolt that unerringly strikes its target for 1d6+1 (converts to either 1 or 2 <i>Scarlet Heroes</i> damage).</p>

<p>Matthias chooses to take a level in Fighter, becoming Mage 1 / Fighter 1. He gains 4 HP for the level in Fighter, plus 2 more HP due to Constitution bonus. These +6 HP raise his maximum health to 16/16 HP. Mattie gains two new Heroic Deeds, and he chooses <i>Effortless Dodge</i> and <i>Oh, Look, More Torches!</i></p>

<p><i>DM Fiat: Magic-Users <u>can</u> use up to medium armor. They cannot cast (usually) if using a shield, as many spells require both hands for somatic components. </i> This means Matthias is definitely looking for a good set of armor. Funds simply ran out after Aury's armor upgrade to scale.</p> 

<p>Matthias's <i>Heroic Deeds</i> known are now: Arcane Deflection, Effortless Dodge, Eldritch Swap, Manipulate Fate, and Oh Look &mdash; Torches! And given his high Intelligence, Mattie can now cast four 1st level spells daily. Auriochos' Heroic Deeds known are now: Arcane Deflection, Blessed Assurance, Eldritch Swap, Healing Surge, and Karmic Balance.</p>

<p><a name="GurskVisions"><b>Gursk's Visions - Oct. 22, 204 PR</b></a></p>

<p>The first of the five undead incursions that goblin shaman <a target="_new" href="terminology.html#gursk">Gursk Spiritspeaker</a> has foreseen occurred on 18 Oct. 204 PR, the second on 22 Oct. 204 PR. The next will occur 30 Oct. 204; the fourth, on Nov 20, 204 PR, and the last (and fifth) on January 1st, 205 PR.</p>

<p>The foregoing timeline is accurate <i>if</i> heroes don't step in and alter the fate of the Scarface goblin tribe &mdash; and indeed of the whole region of Stigrix, for the undead are being created in increasing numbers by some ancient, dark power located somewhere within the bog, presumably within the extensive Barrowmaze, if Gursk's shamanic visions and intuitions are to be trusted.</p>
