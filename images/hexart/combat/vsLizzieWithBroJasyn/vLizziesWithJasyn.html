<p>Our heroes grin at one another. A dozen lizardmen versus the three of them, with the element of surprise?</p>

<p>In the surprise round, Brother Jasyn's dagger scores a hit on one of the lead lizardmen, but Aury's crossbow bolt richochets off armor, and Mattie's hurled dagger is ineffectual. The dark-green partial hexes in the upper right of the map indicate a tree whose space cannot be occupied by a combatant. Mattie uses his <i>Fray Die</i> to put down the injured lizardman.</p>

<p>Aury reaches out, and for the first time uses his magic-user <i>Fray Die</i>, injuring the northernmost lead lizardman. The surprise round ends in the <i>surprised</i> lizardman orienting on the black spruce, from which these injuries have come, and they begin to close as round 1 dawns and the heroes step out from their partial concealment.</p>

<p>"Stay together. Let them come to us," Brother Jasyn, the heroes' guide, instructs. In beautiful synchrony, the two Seekers reach out with their magicks (<i>Fray Dice</i>), putting down the remaining injured lizardman. Meanwhile, multiple lizardmen have closed the distance, and two are able to attack Brother Jasyn in round 1. Brother Jasyn drops to 25/28 HP. He injures the northernmost lizardman with his Fray Die and then makes a melee attack, reducing that lizardman to 1 of 3 HD remaining. The adjacent lizardman rakes Jasyn, but it's a grazing blow that only scratches his leather armor.</p>

<p>In round 1, another lizardman falls. In round two, Aury's mace attack misses and his <i>Fray Die</i> rolls a 1, so is ineffectual. Mattie takes a step northeast, to benefit from Jasyn and Aury's protection. His <i>Fray Die</i> also sucks this round and is ineffectual.</p>

<p>In round 3, two lizardmen attack Aury, and two others attack Jasyn. All miss the heroes.</p>

<p>Round 4: Between his regular melee attack and his <i>Fray Die</i>, Jasyn slays another lizardman. Aury focuses on the lizardman now east of him and southeast of Mattie. His mace regular melee attack inflicts 1 HD of injury, reducing that lizardman to 2 of 3 HD. Aury's <i>Fray Die</i> attack put down another lizardman, while two other foes attack the cleric, one hitting with a claw attack (Aury at 16/17 HP).</p>

<p>And so, as the 4th round ends, we have the following situation:</p>

</center>

<p>Round 5: Mattie makes a melee attack with quarterstaff. His regular melee attack misses but the <i>Fray Die</i> successfully imparts 1 HD of damage. Jasyn gets tagged by both claws and a bite from the lizardman due west of his position, for three more damage, dropping him to 22/28 HP.</p>

<p>Aury faces three lizardmen. The first hits for 1 point, dropping Aury to 15/17 HP. The seconds claws and bites for a total of 2 more damage, dropping Aury to 13/17 HP. The third lizardman hits with a bite for an additional point of damage, dropping Aury to 12/17 HP. Finally, Mattie is attacked by a single injured lizardman. A claw grazes but does no damage. A bite hits for one point, dropping Mattie to 15/16 HP.</p>

<p>And so, as round 5 ends, we have the following situation:</p>

<center>
<img width="64" align="middle" src="../../../../icons/brotherjasyn.png"> Brother Jasyn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img width="64" align="middle" src="../../../../icons/aury.png"> Aury
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img width="64" align="middle" src="../../../../icons/mattie.png"> Mattie<br><br>
<img src="liz2_bottom5th_rnd.png">
</center>

<p>As round 6 begins, Mattie brings his quarterstaff down on his foe, inflicting 2 more HD injury and slaying the lizardman. Then, he tries to slay the lizardman due west of Brother Jasyn with magic from a distance, but fails.</p>

<p>Aury's round 6 regular mace melee attack finishes off a lizardmen. The cleric then reaches out with his mage <i>Fray Die</i> in an attempt to slay from a distance the injured lizardman due west of Brother Jasyn, succeeding!</p>

<p>Brother Jasyn's regular melee and <i>Fray Die</i> attacks finish off another lizardman, leaving us with three lizardmen foes as round 7 arrives.</p>

<p>Time for a morale check. Lizardmen hate the "civilized" bipedal races, so they only need roll below 12 on 2d8: they succeed in their morale check by rolling a 9, and do not flee. The heroes and their guide wind up the battle victoriously, though none of them escaped injury entirely.</p>
