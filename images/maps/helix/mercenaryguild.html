<p>This building serves as the home of the mercenary guild in Helix. Osen, the Guildmaster, created a business for himself recruiting men-at-arms, classed henchmen, porters, torch-bearers, and guides to serve adventurers and expeditions into the Barrowmoor and the surrounding region. In the spring and summer months, when the population of Helix swells with the influx of lowly adventurers, scoundrels, and rogues, Osen and his guild manage to bring order to the village. The locals jokingly refer to the mercenary guild as “The League of
Ordinary Gentlemen.” The roster of men and women available for hire should be randomly determined by the Referee.</p>
