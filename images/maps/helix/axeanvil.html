<p><a href="../../../html/terminology.html#kargBarrelgut">Karg Barrelgut</a> (DWF FGT 4th LV) is the lead hammer at The Axe and Anvil smithy. Barrelgut is a fine craftsman and serves the village in the varied roles of blacksmith, armourer,and weaponsmith, as needed. His young cousin, Gern, works as his apprentice. Barrelgut was originally from the Stone Mountains far across the plains to the east but fled decades ago for an unknown reason.</p>

<p>He has befriended the other dwarves in Helix and his smithy now serves as the defacto dwarven meeting place (social and religious). He can provide all the weapons (except bows and arrows) and most armor types provided in the Labyrinth Lord Rules (plate mail must be ordered from Ironguard Motte on a cash up-front basis and will take one week).</p>

<p>In addition, adventurers can also purchase a Broadsword (1d6+1) from the Axe and Anvil for 8gp. The broadsword is the favoured weapon of warriors in the area. If given sufficient time, Barrelgut can make unique non-magical dungeoneering items and equipment. He is known as a fair dealer in Helix.</p>
