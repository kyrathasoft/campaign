<p>This is the central meeting and marketplace in the village. The village crier makes announcements each day at noon from a dais in the center of the square. These announcements
normally gather a large crowd and provide an excellent opportunity for PCs to learn news or attempt to find hirelings or henchmen, beyond those available in the Mercenary Guild. The cost to solicit hirelings and henchmen through the village crier is 5gp. There is also a pillory in the square that serves as a deterrent for criminals and thieves.</p>
