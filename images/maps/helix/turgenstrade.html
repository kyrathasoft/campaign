<p><a href="../../../html/terminology.html#billworthturgen">Billworth Turgen</a>, a 55 year-old human merchant with 4 HP, has provided basic equipment and trade goods to the villagers of Helix for decades. He also serves as the local agent for the Silver Standard Caravan Company and facilitates shipments back and forth between Helix (dried peat, dried fish, animal skins, giant spider silk from the Blackened Forest, and goats) and Ironguard Motte (return shipments include wine, ale, fine clothing, armour, food stuffs (corn and wheat), metal ingots).</p>

<p>Turgen also hires men-at-arms through the mercenary guild to serve as protection for his caravans. He pays 2gp (per day, per person) and covers lodging (there are basic barracks at each Silver Standard supply depot). If a complete shipment arrives safely Turgen will pay an additional bonus of 2gp.</p>
