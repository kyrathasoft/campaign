<p><b>Fall, 204 PR (Post-Ravaging)</b></p>

<p>Midafternoon finds you at the end of a long day's trek from the village of Dartscale to Wizard's Tower. Fortunately, you paused long enough at Ashbridge to do some fishing. So now, as you and perhaps a dozen other folk local to Stigrix stand around waiting for Tauste to come out on his balcony, you are managing to keep warm as you grill your catch and brew a tin of Henneth over a small cookfire.</p>

<p>You fancy your chances of being picked. The old man always has odd jobs for young hands and strong backs. One of your childhood friends from Padoar tosses his head at you from across the yard, then slinks insouciantly over to you and your fire, a grin on his face. A trio of older men nearby are passing an earthenware jug among themselves and grumbling about the wait.</p>

<p><hr><p>

<p><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="../../icons/tauste_portrait_64.png"></td><td><font size="+2"><b>Tauste</b></font></td></tr></table></p>

<p>Finally, the wizard Tauste comes out onto the balcony. From his perch some sixty feet above the pebbled courtyard, he rakes his keen gaze over those assembled.</p>

<p>"You!" The wizard's right arm leaps out, index finger piercing a fat, middle age bearded man sprawled up against a boulder. "Out! Get out of here, Prugal. I've warned you about trying my patience! Get ye hence or I'll loose Wags on you!"</p>

<p>Apparently, Prugal fears Wags, or perhaps he's tasted the wizard's wrath itself in the past. The slovenly man waddles away as quickly as his poor physique will allow, and the wizard gets down to business, handing out assignments, haggling over barter or coin. One young man quickly accepts a coin dropped from the balcony then heads northwest, deeper into the forested hills to hunt for the wizard.</p>

<p>The three men who have shared an earthenware jug of strong drink accept the wizard's offer to discharge their existing debt by whitewashing the wizard's tower.</p>

<p>Finally, only three of you remain. Well then, you two," he fixes Faramund and another with a bushy-eyebrowed gaze. "I've only a few sensitive matters remaining. You may enter my abode if you wish to discuss it." And with that, the old man turns from the balcony and disappears back inside his strong tower.</p>

<p><hr><p>

<p><table border="0"><tr><td><img src=""></td><td><font size="+2"><b>Faramund</b></font></td></tr></table></p>

<p>Faramund takes a long draught of henneth and then sets the tin down on one of the smooth, flat stones surrounding the fire ring.  Grabbing his claymore and slinging it across his shoulders, shrugging it into place.  “I’m heading inside to find out what this is all about,” he says to the other two remaining men waiting. “I’ll see you inside.” He turns and strides to the tower doorway, opens the door and steps inside.</p>

<p><hr><p>

<p><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="../../icons/tauste_portrait_64.png"></td><td><img src="../../icons/Wags_64.png"></td><td><font size="+2"><b>Tauste & Wags</b></font></td></tr></table></p>	

<p>Inside, the tower is much as you probably expected: dark and cool, lit by flaming braziers set at intervals in the stone wall of the entrance hallway.</p>

<p>As you enter, Wags takes a step forward then sits, having placed himself between you and his master. He doesn't growl, but his tongue isn't lolling friendily out of his mouth either.</p>

<p>"Well then," Tauste begins, looking you up and down. After a moment, he bellows, "Juric, attend our guests!" He then beckons for you to follow, turns, and begins ascending a spiraling stone staircase that hugs the side of the tower's interior. Wags pointedly waits for you to follow the wizard, then follows as third in the wizard's retinue.</p>

<p>Climbing, you glance back and down into the large circular entrance level. A young boy brings a wash pan for the other two men who were given admittance. Wags notes your glance disapprovingly and growls low in his throat.</p>

<p>Half a minute later, you've reached the second level of the tower, a spacious circular room sixty feet in diameter that the wizard has divided into thirds: a laboratory, a study, and his bed and breakfast area. He turns, gestures for you to be seated. "An Eirengarder, eh? I'm surprised you risked the wilds and the bloody Shou to reach Stigrix, or did you come as part of a large caravan?"</p>

<p>Faramund unslings his sword and takes the proffered seat, leaning the large blade against the back of the chair.  “M’Lord, my journey here was more indirect than that.  My father is a minor lord in the southern reaches of The Hornberg… a very small, hardly significant holding.  As the youngest of four sons, I had no great role to play in the management of my father’s affairs.  After reaching my name day, my uncle Ulred took me on as a squire and I served in his mercenary company.  We were often hired to guard caravans as you intimated.  Our most recent journey was to the great city of Xian.  Once we completed our contract, my Uncle advised that it was a good time for me to freelance and make my own name.  He advised that I come here to Stigrix and offer my services.  He used to serve under a former Imperial General that retired and travelled here years ago, and gave me a recommendation to hand to him.  You probably know the man… General Santiro.” . He pauses for a moment and slowly shakes his head.  “Unfortunately, no one has seen the General in over a year.  He seems to have disappeared without a trace.”</p>

<p>He pauses again, then looks up.  “What is it you wished to speak to me about M’Lord?”</p>

<p><i>Sat 21 Oct 2023 at 20:08</i></p>

<p><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="../../icons/tauste_portrait_64.png"></td><td><font size="+2"><b>Tauste</b></font></td></tr></table></p>	

<p>Tauste's brow scrunches his face momentarily into a thunderhead of dismay. "As you may or may not know, I am quite familiar with General Santiro, as he was my apprentice up until a little over a year ago." His brow gradually relaxes, but his blue eyes remain piercing, hawk-like. "Gutbuster brigade out of Sanflao; came up through the ranks as an engineer, but was promoted from lieutenant to major at the age of twenty-nine."</p>

<p>Apparently, your association with General Santiro scores high marks with the wizard, as he pours you each two fingers of Tien Lung hasiko brandy from a pewter flask. "He semi-retired, took the title of castellan at Smokeshadow Keep, in service to Baron Kai -- a role that left him with ample free time. I struck up a friendship with the General, as I call upon the baron weekly for a game of chess. I immediately took a liking to the man and his keen, engineer's mind. At his request, and with Baron Kai's approval, I took Santiro on as an apprentice."</p>

<p>He is quite for long moments, sipping brandy. Finally, "No small measure of effort and funds were expended by the baron in seeking Santiro when he disappeared. He was not the sort of character to go on a high lonesome without letting others know. As I understand it, the baron is still offering a sizable reward for finding the general." He shifts, making himself more comfortable. "As for me, I'm looking for a reliable man to survey, plunder, and report back to me on an old abandoned fort some two days journey northeast of Smokeshadow. It pays five hundred gold coins, more if I buy any treasures you manage to bring back..."</p>

<p><hr><p>

<p>Faramund accepts the pour of brandy with a gracious smile, bowing his head slightly at Tauste.  “Thank you M’Lord,” he says warmly.  Taking a sip of the amber colored spirit, he lets out a satisfied sigh.</p>

<p>“I was not aware of your association with the General; I have only arrived here recently and I am still uninformed about many local matters.  Perhaps as I learn more I could aid in locating him.”</p>

<p>He takes another drink of the Brandy.  “I accept your proposal to survey this abandoned fort, this is just the kind of mission I’ve been looking for.  I can start immediately, I’ll just need to pick up some rations and supplies.  Is there any specific information or items you want me to focus on obtaining for you?”</p>

<p><i>Sun 22 Oct 2023 at 18:45</i></p>

<p><hr><p>

<p><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="../../icons/tauste_portrait_64.png"></td><td><font size="+2"><b>Tauste</b></font></td></tr></table></p>	

<p>The wizard nods as he realizes that your mutual acquaintance with the missing general is coincidence. "An auspicious coincidence, then, is our joint knowledge of our missing general. I would indeed welcome any help you can lend in determining his whereabouts or fate."</p>

<p>He pours himself another finger of the hot and fizzy apple-flavored liquor, glances at you to offer the same. "My primary interest in the abandoned fort is to clear it of any vermin and liberate any valuables it may contain. The baron and I have a vested interest in it not becoming -- or at least not remaining -- a hideout for rogues. Or worse, for the bloody Shou.</p>

<p>I've no interest in its mundane contents. You're welcome to any treasure you find. I am interested in anything having an aura of geomantic force, whether faint or strong. But given the fact that you could simply decline this job offer and keep anything you find there anyway, I will simply ask that you give me the option of identifying any such finds and making an offer to purchase them from you. You'd retain the option of selling or keeping each such item."</p>

<p>He produces parchment, a quill, and a small ink bottle and begins to write. "This letter of credit is equivalent to five hundred royals, and will be honored in Dolecherry, Silent Diamond, Padoar, Dartscale, Mimsy, Slaytonthorpe, Blacktooth, or Smokeshadow. They'll also price things for a slimmer profit when they see that I'm paying." He seals the letter by pressing his signet ring into a small pool of hot wax, then rolls it up and packages it in a leather scroll tube that he slides across the table to you.</p>

<p>"For the next ten-day, as long as you carry that letter of credit on your person, you'll be able to see all geomantic auras without effort. Well, all except my own."</p>

<p><i>This message was last edited by the player at 16:27, Sat 11 Nov.</i></p>

<p><hr><p>

<p>Faramund takes the scroll tube and tucks it into his tunic.  "Very generous of you M'lord to advance the full amount.  It shows a great deal of trust in me.  I will endeavor to show you that it is well placed."</p>

<p>He finishes the small amount of brandy still remaining in his glass, then continues.  "I assume there is an old road running between Smokethefuck and the abandoned fort you want me to survey, although likely in poor condition.  My thought is to hire a few porters and some men at arms to travel with me and set up a small camp near the site.  The porters to, of course, assist in transporting whatever goods we find, and the men at arms to keep watch over them while I work the area.  What is your opinion of my plan?  Premature to bring help along?"</p>

<p>Tauste arches a bushy, white eyebrow. "Well, I've no objection. Just choose carefully. I'll warn you against Prugal, a slovenly and untrustworthy man." The wizard stands and runs a hand through his silken beard. "There used to be a road paralleling the Clearstream on its eastern bank, but it has long since faded. The fort has been abandoned for years. I'm afraid you'll have to do some exploration. I have a report from a ranger that passed through a month back that the abandoned fort is somewhere in the hills between the river and Lonetower, north-northeast of ... Smokethefuck, I believe you called it. Ranger was a bit miffed we didn't hire him as a guide, didn't leave us very good directions."</p>

<p>He replaces the flask of liquor on an ornate brass shelf, then turns back to you. "It's doubtful, but there's a chance you could encounter remnants of past cultures, if the fort has sub-levels. It's unlikely, unless there happens to be a connection with the Great Beneath. If you encounter anything passingly strange, that you've never see before, be wary. It'll be undoubtedly valuable and possibly dangerous. And there are some who would quickly put a knife between your ribs to obtain such treasures."</p>

<p>As the two of you make your way toward the stairwell, you see a purple aura limning the stone archway leading onto the landing. He shakes your hand, then holds position at the top of the winding stairs. You begin descending to the ground floor, noting a flickering yellow aura on the stairs. From behind you, "If the next young man I interview pans out, I may send him to call on you. Where will you be staying as you plan your expedition? I recommend The Blue Shou in Padoar."</p>

<p>After leaving Wizard's Tower, you were able to haggle a boat crossing of the Ash River for a single khopec (i.e., equivalent to one copper piece). Thereafter, you followed Pado Brook southwest, arriving in Padoar just before twilight.</p>

<p>To your mild (but fading, as you begin to take the measure of the man named Tauste) surprise, your arrival is expected in the village, and a boy of about eight grins as you enter through the palisade gate. "Yer the warrior I'm ta' greet. Come with me..."</p>

<p>The boy leads you to The Blue Shou, the village's only inn, and there you find the proprietor, a Fey Folk named Tibald, waiting to greet you. Tibald is a small female, standing about five feet in height, and perhaps weighing six stone.</p>

<p>"Sir, a room is made ready for you, and I have stew, sourdough bread, butter and honey, and a flagon of Sanflao Stout whenever you wish to dine. I'm to offer you every hospitality."</p>

<p>The boy who led you here has disappeared somewhere up the stairs to the second floor. Presumably, he's an all-around errand boy.</p>

<p>When you duck into your room to unburden yourself of your pack and to wash up, you find a clean bed with a course woolen blanket and a straw-filled pillow. A kerosene lamp is full of oil but unlit. Between a pair of heavy brass dragon bookends are four books, an impressive show of decadence, given how rare such things are. Their titles are: The Eras: Bedtime Stories for Grownups, Finding Your Phyrim, The White Bear of Judgment, and The Origin of the Deep Folk.</p>

<p>Back in the common room once again, a farmer and his wife dine together quietly. A cloaked, hooded man sits before the fire, with a bottle of wine and a glass, and three workers from the nearby Carman Mine are eating together at a trestle table.</p>

<p><i>This message was last edited by the player at 16:28, Sat 11 Nov.</i></p>

<p><hr></p>

<p>Faramund nods and smiles to the farmer and his wife, the only other people in the common area who seem to notice or take interest in his appearance.  He pulls out a chair at one of the empty tables and sits down.  Catching Tibald's attention, he smiles and motions to her to come over, and after exchanging a few pleasantries, he informs her he is ready to enjoy the meal she described to him earlier upon is arrival at the inn.</p>

<p>The Sanflao Stout is better than he remembers from the last time he tried it, and the rest of the meal is excellent.  Not much time passes before all of the food is gone and the proprietor has collected the dishes and taken them away from the table. The flagon of ale remains, and he sips slowly from a pewter mug, enjoying the aroma and flavor.  He appears to be deep in thought, and indeed is pouring over what he learned in his mind, and putting together a plan of how to complete the task at hand and what supplies he needs to procure before setting out.</p>

<div class="red"><p>[Private to GM: Wondering if you want to roleplay any interactions in the common room (hooded stranger?) or move the story along to the wilderness exploration.  Faramund is having second thoughts about hiring porters and guards, thinking maybe it would be better to go alone for the survey work and if needed get help to travel back for any large items that needed transport.  Thinking he would spend the next day procuring some equipment for the trip-- some rations, bedroll, tent, fire starting kit, waterskins, that kind of stuff.  And he needs a dagger or a short sword.  You want to roleplay the shopping trip or move on past that stuff?]</p></div>

<p><hr></p>

<p><table border="0"><tr><font size="+2"><b>GM</b></font></td></tr></table></p>	

<p>Tibald and a servant clear away dishes, and then the latter begins to mop the common room floor, a prosaic task -- the irony of which is lost on those present, who cannot fathom that literally hundreds of thousands of years ago, servants did the same thing in post-industrial American bars and restaurants.</p>

<p>Faramund can hear common laborers' gripes coming from the trio of copper and silver miners at a nearby table. Our protagonist catches snatches of conversation from the burly men: "...wouldn't be surprised if Old Man Carman doesn't push for opening a fifth level down, but that hardly seems...". And: "...the occasional Shou scout; at least he pays well and...". And: "..."the Mire; if it keeps on expanding..." And: "...even be worth mining except for the transgenerator, especially this winter..."</p>

<p>Darkness has fallen outside. A teenage, curly-haired youth enters, arms burdened with two large orbular guords of a yellow-orange color. He smiles at the servant, passes a pleasantry you don't quite hear, and arranges the guords, one in each window of the common room before placing and carefully lighting a small taper inside each. As he leaves, you see a small girl on the other side of the window, tugging at her mother's hand to delay and admire the lit guords.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one-quarter of a mile north of the village...<p>

<p>Deatre squats, forearms resting on knees, peering down at the sleepy village of Padoar as twilight slowly engulfs it. She watches as a village farmer's cart of pumpkins trundles westward off the Farground Road and into the small community. She pulls on a cigar then blows a series of smoke rings, stands, adjusts her hat. "All right, wizard, I'll play along for a bit longer at least..." Another long pull on the last of her cigar, then she drops it and grinds it out with one booted foot before striking off down the hill toward the village.</p>

<div class="red"><p>[Private to Faramund Beckette: Up to you if you want to RP provisioning. I'm fine on hand-waving it and quoting you a lump sum to acquire the items you mentioned. Lump sum for all of the following will run you 70 royals: some rations, bedroll, tent, fire starting kit, waterskins, dagger, short sword, 100' hemp rope, grappling hook. The tent is a 3-man A-frame made of some ultralight and tough material that changes color over all its surface to camoflage the tent with the prevailing environmental background colors. The entire tent is five pounds and compresses to a bundle 3"x4"x6".</p>

<p>Your call regarding the stranger with the hood. I'm thinking Seth isn't going to join. I advertised for a single player. My thought was try him/her in a separate group and if they seem compatible, they might become Faramund's companion -- though you may prefer to remain strictly solo, and if so feel free to say so.]</p></div>

<p>Finishing his stout, Faramund sets his tankard down and stands up from the table, stretching and yawning.  He turns and heads for the stairs, nodding to the other patrons as he leaves the common room.</p>

<p>Entering his room, he finds the bed turned down and the lamp lit.  He smiles and shakes his head in near disbelief at the high quality treatment he is receiving the benefit of from the staff of the small inn.  A few moments later, he snuffs the lamp and is fast asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning finds him up with the sunrise.  Grabbing his sword, he pads lightly down the stairs so as to avoid waking any of his fellow patrons.  Entering the common room, he is not surprised to hear noise from the kitchen, likely Tibald and her staff preparing breakfast.  He makes his way outside to the small yard behind the inn.</p>

<p>Drawing his long blade, he steps lightly forward and begins working through sword forms, his blade hissing through the air.  Thrusting, spinning... high, low, moving side to side, weaving.  He works for nearly half an hour, finally ending the dance with wind rustling the reeds.</p>

<p>Catching his breath, he sheaths his blade, shouldering it as he makes his way back into the common room.  Catching Tibald's attention he smiles as she hands him a fresh cup of henneth, and he takes the same table and seat at which he enjoyed dinner the night before.  Soon the table is covered with eggs and bacon, pancakes with maple syrup, and fresh fruit.  Digging in, he works his way through the breakfast quickly, having worked up an appetite.</p>

<div class="red"><p>[Private to GM: Let's RP some stuff after breakfast, then we can fast forward through the shopping trip and get on the road to the abandoned fort.  As far as adding in another player, I am totally good with that whenever it is the right time.  In the meantime-- Faramund has had second thoughts about hiring porters and guards after his conversation with Tauste, figuring it will be better to go alone and clear the fort before trying to haul out any loot.  However, any potential for a hireling NPC to join him?  What are your thoughts there? ]</p></div>

<p>You're half way through breakfast when the hooded figure, presumably the same one you saw by the fire drinking wine the previous evening, comes down the stairs. He is short and thin, and wears a dark green robe; a rope belt holds a scabbarded rapier, and the hood which covers his head also obscures his face. He takes a seat at a nearby booth, and a servant approaches to take his order. The hooded customer has a raspy voice and speaks with a very decided accent, one you cannot place.</p>

<p>A woman enters then stands still as the door closes, allowing her eyes to adjust to the dimmer interior while each hand rests lightly on some sort of weapon holstered at her hips. Her eyes seem to take in everything, and there is a moment where it feels like the entire common room takes in a deeply held breath of suppressed angst; then she moves toward a table and the spell is broken. She sits, rolls her neck and places her hat across the table, shaking out long, brunette tresses.</p>

<p>The hooded figure in the booth sips hot henneth, while the woman unslings a leather pack and deposits it at her feet, then nudges it under the table with a boot. With a tilt of her head, she looks at you: "Do you recommend the bacon?"</p>
