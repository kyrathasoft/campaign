<p><b>Fall, 204 PR (Post-Ravaging)</b></p>

<p>Midafternoon finds you at the end of a long day's trek from the village of Dartscale to Wizard's Tower. Fortunately, you paused long enough at Ashbridge to do some fishing. So now, as you and perhaps a dozen other folk local to Stigrix stand around waiting for Tauste to come out on his balcony, you are managing to keep warm as you grill your catch and brew a tin of Henneth over a small cookfire.</p>

<p>You fancy your chances of being picked. The old man always has odd jobs for young hands and strong backs. One of your childhood friends from Padoar tosses his head at you from across the yard, then slinks insouciantly over to you and your fire, a grin on his face. A trio of older men nearby are passing an earthenware jug among themselves and grumbling about the wait.</p>

<p>Finally, the wizard Tauste comes out onto the balcony. From his perch some sixty feet above the pebbled courtyard, he rakes his keen gaze over those assembled.</p>

<p>"You!" The wizard's right arm leaps out, index finger piercing a fat, middle age bearded man sprawled up against a boulder. "Out! Get out of here, Prugal. I've warned you about trying my patience! Get ye hence or I'll loose Wags on you!"</p>

<p>Apparently, Prugal fears Wags, or perhaps he's tasted the wizard's wrath itself in the past. The slovenly man waddles away as quickly as his poor physique will allow, and the wizard gets down to business, handing out assignments, haggling over barter or coin. One young man quickly accepts a coin dropped from the balcony then heads northwest, deeper into the forested hills to hunt for the wizard.</p>

<p>The three men who have shared an earthenware jug of strong drink accept the wizard's offer to discharge their existing debt by whitewashing the wizard's tower.</p>

<p>Finally, only three of you remain. Well then, you two," he fixes Faramund and another with a bushy-eyebrowed gaze. "I've only a few sensitive matters remaining. You may enter my abode if you wish to discuss it." And with that, the old man turns from the balcony and disappears back inside his strong tower.</p>

<p><table border="0"><tr><td><img src=""></td><td><font size="+2"><b>Faramund</b></font></td></tr></table></p>

<p>Faramund takes a long draught of henneth and then sets the tin down on one of the smooth, flat stones surrounding the fire ring.  Grabbing his claymore and slinging it across his shoulders, shrugging it into place.  “I’m heading inside to find out what this is all about,” he says to the other two remaining men waiting. “I’ll see you inside.” He turns and strides to the tower doorway, opens the door and steps inside.</p>
