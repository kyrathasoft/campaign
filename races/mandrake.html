<p>Mandrakes are related to treants, though the origins of both are so ancient that details have been lost &mdash; or at least, so sages believe. Mandrakes are medium-sized creatures that generally stand between sixty and seventy-eight inches tall. They are comprised of extremely dense xylem and phloem, giving them a base AC of 5. They cannot wear armor, but their Dexterity modifier does apply to their armor class. As mandrakes age, they only grow tougher. Some hoary old mandrakes have a base AC or 2, or even 1. However, they are prone to suffer aging deficits in Dexterity.</p>

<p>A mandrake grows to adulthood among trees of other types in a forest, achieving full growth and becoming self-aware in three years, at which point they pull up roots and become mobile, venturing beyond their birthplace, like a bird leaving its nest.</p>
