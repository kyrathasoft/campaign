<p><b>Campaign Start & Session Zero</b>: Monday, 25 Dec. 2023</p>

<p><b>Dungeon Master:</b> Bryan Miller</p>

<p><b>Play Time:</b> ~ 6:30-8:45 pm CST</p>

<p><b>Synopsis:</b> Players were Susan, Grant, Lauren, and Christian. They played pregenerated characters <a href="../characters/char_feyre.html">Feyre Archeron</a> (Elf MU), <a href="../characters/char_lancaster.html">Lancaster Fox</a> (Halfling THF), <a href="../characters/char_celaena.html">Celaena Sardothien</a> (Human FGT), and a (Hill Dwarf CLE) &mdash; no name on the character sheet.</p>

<p>The player-characters (minus the dwarf) were ambushed by six goblins as they were headed from Phandelver to the village of Helix. They made short work of the goblins. Upon reaching Helix, they obtained healing at the temple of Oghma, purchased some much needed healing potions, and gathered information at the local tavern.<p>

<p>They solicited the help of a dwarven cleric, who led them north out of town, to an old abandoned mine. There, they discovered goblins and orcs apparently in collusion of some sort in service to the mysterious <i>G.</i> Could this be the same <i>G.</i> who signed the letter they had found in a scroll tube on one of the goblins after defeating the ambush earlier in the day?</p>

<p>The party found an underground lake but believed they'd been detected by orcs and goblins there &mdash; races that don't typically cooperate with one another. Backtracking, they took a side passage down which they'd earllier seen a lone pack lizard descend. Coming out into a cavern, they discovered mine carts with various valuables. One held coal, another <i>mithril</i>, and another silver.<p>

<p>The party hid when they heard voices approaching. A group of nine goblins and three giant pack lizards made camp and the goblins began cooking. Lancaster, the halfling thief, failed a move silently check and the party went ahead and surprise attacked, slaying all the goblins. One of the pack lizards fled, but the party members managed to exit the mines with the two pack lizards packing a considerable amount of silver, mithril ores, and red cuprous.</p>

<p>The next session should pick up with the party exiting the mine at about one hour until sundown.</p>
