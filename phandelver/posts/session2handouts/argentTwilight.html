<p>Here is the letter that they ensure comes into Feyre's possession while she and her fellows are in Phandalin:</p>

<p><i>Feyre, we have had our eye on you for awhile now. We are <i>Argent Twilight</i>. As an adventurer, you are in a position to be valuable to us. We seek the reclamation of lost ancient knowledge, magic, and technology. We believe that the pursuit of knowledge alone justifies this. But we pursue these goals not solely for these reclamations themselves, but more importantly for the improved security and standard of living their recovery would engender. We are prepared to offer you ... generous inducements. If you are interested in meeting for further discussion, please leave at message at the Stonehill Inn for Lady K. The proprietor will make us aware.</i></p>
