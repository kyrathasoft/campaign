<p>The <i><a href="../../../html/terminology.html#orderGauntlet">Order of the Gauntlet</a></i> approaches Lancaster via Daran Edermath in Phandalin.</p>

<p>Here is what the retired elven adventurer Daran Edermath says to Lancaster Fox in Phandalin:</p>

<p><i>"Lancaster, the Redbrands gang has been bullying the village folk these past two months. When a local woodcarver, Thel Dendrar, stood up to them for leering at his wife, they murdered him. There are witnesses. Now, I'm retired, but I used to be a member of a rather special order &mdash; The Order of the Gauntlet &mdash; it's an order to protect goodly folk against bullies, slavers, extortioners, and any and all other forms of ne'er-do-wells. I would like ... to sponsor <b>you</b> as a new member. You have connections. You think fast on your feet. You'd be valuable to the organization. There are ... perks, monetarily and otherwise. And were you to take care of these Redbrands, teach them a lesson, I think my nomination of you for membership would be very well-received..."</i></p>
